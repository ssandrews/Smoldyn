# This could also be represented with the sole rule * + A <-> *A.  However, that has
# the same reaction rate for all reactions.  Here, the monomer association reaction
# is twice as fast, working on the assumption that its association can happen in either
# of two ways, which makes it consistent with tbe BioNetGen model of the same name.
