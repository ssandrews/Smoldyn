# The transmission coefficient ratio equals the equilibrium concentration ratio.
# The eq. concentration ratio is independent of diffusion coefficients, which can
# be seen from the Boltzmann distribution and assuming equal energy inside and
# outside the rafts, which then implies that the transmission coefficient ratio
# is the same in both directions.
