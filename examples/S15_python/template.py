name, the development date, what this file does, the model name if you want
one, units used, the file version, distribution terms, etc.

Enzymatic reactions on a surface, by Steve Andrews, October 2009. Modified by
Dilawar Singh, 2020. This model is in the public domain. Units are microns and seconds.
The model was published in Andrews (2012) Methods for Molecular Biology, 804:519.
It executes a Michaelis-Menten reaction within and on the surface of a 2D circle.
