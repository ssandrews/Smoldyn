# Smoldyn-official
Smoldyn is a particle-based biochemical simulator for modeling molecular diffusion, surface interactions, and chemical reactions.

The Smoldyn webpage is at http://www.smoldyn.org. Go there to learn about Smoldyn, download the latest release, etc. This repository is here so that developers can collaborate on the code. This is the official Smoldyn repository, run by the main Smoldyn author, Steve Andrews.

I welcome new contributions to the code. However, I also want to maintain Smoldyn's current design philosophy, so please contact me before writing new code so that we can discuss how additions can be made most useful. I am at steven.s.andrews@gmail.com.
