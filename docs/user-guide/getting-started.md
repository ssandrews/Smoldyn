Smoldyn should be run from a command line interface. For Macs, use the
application called `Terminal`, which you can find by searching for it, or it
should be in your `/Applications/Utilities` directory. For Windows, use the
application called `Command Prompt`, which is easiest to find by searching for
it using the `Start Menu`.

Open Smoldyn files in a text editor. For Macs, TextEdit works well,
*except* that it does not let you start with a new file and then save it
as plain text. Instead, it only saves new files as rich text format. The
solution is to copy an example file first, rename it to your new file
name, and then edit it. You can also use Microsoft Word and save as
plain text. For Windows, NotePad does not work well because it doesn’t
display line breaks correctly. Instead, use Microsoft Word and save as
plain text.

From a command line, run Smoldyn by entering smoldyn followed by the
name of your input file. For example, if you are in the Smoldyn parent
directory, enter `smoldyn examples/template.txt` to run that file. You
should see output that looks like this:

![](../media/image1.png)

This file shows enzymatic catalysis, in which green dots are substrate, blue
dots are product, enzyme is dark red, and enzyme-substrate complexes are
orange. The substrate and product molecules are `solution phase`, while the
enzyme and enzyme-substrate complexes are `surface-bound` (e.g. the enzyme is
an integral membrane protein).

Note that you can zoom in or out with the ‘=’ and ‘-’ keys and you can pan with
shift-arrow keys (arrow keys enable rotating with 3D simulations, but not here
because this is a 2D simulation). Pressing ‘0’ returns to the default view. You
can also press shift-‘T’ to take a snapshot of the output, the space bar to
pause the simulation, or shift-‘Q’ to quit the simulation.

## Smoldyn input file format

Here is the complete Smoldyn input file for the template.txt simulation.
This file includes most of Smoldyn’s core features.

```

### Comments

All text after a `#` character is a comment and is ignored by Smoldyn.  In
these comments, it is good practice to list basic information about the model
such as what it represents, the model units, who wrote the file, and
distribution terms. This particular file has comments on almost every line in
order to explain what’s happening, but this is typically more annoying than
useful.

### Measurement units

Notably absent from input file are any measurement units. Instead, you need to
choose a single set of units and to then use these throughout the file. For
example, cgs units (centimeter-gram-second) and mks units
(meter-kilogram-second) are two standard unit systems. These are too
large-scale to be convenient for most Smoldyn simulations, so micron-second and
nanometer-microsecond tend to be preferable. The following table lists
reasonably typical values for different processes in several different unit
systems.

### Model parameters

It is easier to read and edit Smoldyn files if the model parameters that you
might want to vary are not hard-coded into the model, but are collected at the
top of the file in a collection of define statements.  These statements
instruct Smoldyn to perform simple text replacement, replacing every subsequent
instance of the matching text with the following substitution text. The
statement `define K_FWD 0.001`, for example, tells Smoldyn to replace any
subsequent `K_FWD` text with 0.001; in this case, this is a reaction rate
constant. The substitution text can be a number, multiple numbers, a string, or
even nothing at all.

### Graphical output

Graphical output can be displayed with several levels of quality. At the bottom
end is no output at all, achieved with the `graphics none` statement or by
using a `-t` flag on the command line (e.g. `$ smoldyn template.txt -t`). Next
the `graphics opengl` level produces crude graphics, `graphics opengl_good` is
passable, and `opengl_better` is reasonably good. Improving the graphics
quality slows simulations down, so a good approach is to use the plain `opengl`
level for model development, no graphics when generating simulation results,
and `opengl_better` when preparing publication figures.

As used here, the `framethickness` statement tells Smoldyn to not show a
frame around the entire simulation volume. There are also other
statements for controlling the background color, the frame display, etc.

### Space and time

Smoldyn can run simulations in 1, 2, or 3 dimensions. Here, the `dim 2`
statement says that this is a 2D simulation. The following two `boundaries`
statements define the system volume, showing that it extends from -1 to 1 on
the x axis, and then the same on the y axis.  Smoldyn still tracks any
molecules beyond these boundaries but it becomes less efficient if there are
substantial dynamics there.

Simulations use fixed time steps. They start at the time given with
`time_start`, stop at the time given with `time_stop` and have steps
with the size given with `time_step`. For typical simulations of
subcellular processes, 10 ms is often a reasonable time step. Longer
time steps make the simulation run faster and shorter time steps produce
more accurate results. 

!!! tip "Choosing time step"
    Before starting a long series of simulations, it is good practice to run
    several tests first to ensure that the time step is short enough to produce
    results of the desired accuracy but also long enough for adequate
    efficiency.

### Molecules

All of the chemical species in the simulation need to be declared with a
`species` statement before they can be used in the simulation (except
when using rule-based modeling, as explained later on).

The following `difc`, `color`, and `display_size` statements define the
diffusion coefficients, graphical display colors, and graphical display sizes
for these different species. These parameters can vary for different molecule
states, meaning whether the molecule is in solution or bound to a surface; the
latter case, it can be bound to a surface in any of the `front`, `back`, `up`,
or `down` states. If no molecule state is listed, such as in the statement
`difc S 3`, this applies to only the solution state; if one of these substrate
molecules were to bind to a surface, it would not diffuse because the
surface-bound diffusion coefficients are all still equal to 0. For convenience,
these species parameters can be defined for all of the states at once by using
`all` as the state, such as in the statement `color S(all) green`.

The behavior of the `display_size` statement depends on the graphical output
style. For the `opengl` graphics level, the display size value is in pixels.
Here, numbers from 2 to 4 are typically good choices. For the two better
graphics options, the display size value is the radius with which the molecule
is drawn, using the same units as elsewhere in the input file.

### Surfaces

Smoldyn surfaces are infinitesimally thin structures that can be used to
represent cell membranes, obstructions, system boundaries, or other things.
They are 2D structures in 3D simulations, or 1D lines or curves in 2D
simulations (or 0D points in 1D simulations). Each surface has a `front` and a
`back` face, so molecules can interact differently with the two sides of a
surface. Each surface is composed of one or more `panel`s, where each panel
can be a rectangle, triangle, sphere, hemisphere, cylinder, or a disk. Surfaces
can be disjoint, with separate non-connected portions. However, all portions of
a given surface type are displayed in the same way and interact with molecules
in the same way.

Surfaces get defined in `surface blocks`, which start with `start_surface` and
the surface name, and end with `end_surface`.  Within the surface block, define
molecule interactions with this surface using the `action` or `rate`
statements. In this case, the statement `action all both reflect` states that
molecules of all species should reflect off of this surface upon collision with
either of the two faces.  Other action options are `absorb` and `transmit`, for
absorption by the surface, and transmission through the surface, respectively.
Use the `rate` statement, which is not used in this file, for adsorption,
desorption, or partial transmission through a surface.

Define surface graphics using the `color` and `thickness` statements. For 3D
simulations, the `polygon` statement is useful as well. With it, you can
specify whether you want Smoldyn to draw just the panel edges (typically
the best choice), the entire panel face, or other options.

Surface panels definitions list each panel within the surface, including
details about the panel location, orientation, and display. The sequence
of these parameters is hard to remember but is described in the
reference section of this manual. In this particular case, the statement
`panel sphere 0 0 1 50` indicates that there should be a single
spherical panel (actually a circle because this is a 2D simulation) with
its center at the coordinates (0,0). This circle should have radius of 1
and get drawn with 50 straight line segments. The front face of this
circle is on the outside and the back face is on the inside (this can be
reversed by giving the radius with a negative value).

### Compartments

Compartments are defined regions of space. They have essentially no role in the
actual functioning of the simulation but can be useful for placing and
observing molecules. Their only simulation role is that reactions can be
qualified so that they only occur within specific compartments (which does not
happen in this input file).

As with surfaces, compartments are defined with blocks of text. Each
block starts with `start_compartment` and the compartment name and ends
with `end_compartment`. Within the block, list the surface or surfaces
that form the boundaries to this compartment. Also, list at least one
`interior-defining point` (a set of coordinates) that is inside the
compartment, so Smoldyn knows which region is the inside and which is
the outside. In this file, the circle is the compartment bounding
surface and a point at the center of the circle is the interior-defining
point, so the compartment represents the entire region within the
circle.

Intuitively, the region of a compartment should be defined as everywhere
in space to which one can "walk" from the interior-defining point,
without crossing any of the bounding surfaces. However, for
computational efficiency, Smoldyn uses a slightly different definition.
In Smoldyn, the region of a compartment is everywhere in space from
which one can `see` the interior-defining point using a straight line,
without crossing any of the bounding surfaces. The difference between
the definitions is minimal is many cases, but can be important.

### Reactions

Smoldyn only simulates elementary chemical reactions, such as unimolecular
conversions and bimolecular associations. Multistep reactions, like
Michaelis-Menten reactions, need to be constructed from their elementary
reactions. List each reaction with the `reaction` statement followed by: the
reaction name, the reactants, a forward arrow, the products, and the reaction
rate constant.

Both reactant and product names can be followed by their states, listed in
parentheses. These states are essentially the same as those for the molecule
diffusion coefficient and color statements. The difference is that the solution
state now subdivides into the two pseudo-states `fsoln` and `bsoln`, where
these indicate the solution state that is on the front or back, respectively,
of the relevant surface. In this file, for example, the reaction `reaction fwd
E(front) + S(bsoln) -> ES(front) K_FWD` occurs between enzyme molecules that
are surface-bound in their front state and substrate molecules that are in the
solution on the back side of the surface, meaning inside the circle. The
product is in the front state. If any state is not listed, Smoldyn assumes the
`fsoln` state (which is identical to the normal solution state).

To simulate unimolecular reactions, Smoldyn computes a reaction probability per
time step. Then, during the simulation, it reacts molecules of the given
species with the computed probability at each time step. For bimolecular
reactions, Smoldyn combines the reaction rate constant, the reactant diffusion
coefficients, and the simulation time step to compute a `binding radius`.
Larger reaction rate constants lead to larger binding radii. During the
simulation, if two reactants end up within this binding radius of each other at
the end of a time step, then Smoldyn performs the reaction. It is also possible
to specify that these reactions should only happen with some probability, but
this has very little benefit and so is not standard.

Reversible association/dissociation reactions have the additional complexity
that the dissociation product molecules start out in close proximity and so
have a high probability of rapidly reacting with each other in a so-called
`geminate recombination`. Smoldyn controls the probability of geminate
recombinations, as opposed to products diffusing apart and not re-reacting, by
initially separating products by an `unbinding radius`. There is extremely
little information in the scientific literature about what the probability of
geminate recombinations should be. As a result, Smoldyn sets this probability
to a maximum value of 0.2 by default. I chose this to balance the physical
situation that product molecules should be produced reasonably close together
with the simulation practicality that simulating geminate recombinations is
computationally costly. Because this default value is a very rough guess,
Smoldyn emits a warning if it is not over-ridden by the input file. The line
`product_placement back pgemmax 0.2` prevents this warning by explicitly
specifying that the products of the reaction named back should be placed so
that the maximum probability of geminate recombination is 0.2.

Similar reaction statements can be used for other molecule-molecule
interactions, such as excluded volume interactions and `conformational
spread reactions`; in the latter case, the proximity of one molecule
affects the unimolecular reactions of another molecule.

### Initial molecule placement

Place molecules in a simulation at the starting time using several `mol`
statements. The plain `mol` statement place molecules with random or
specific positions in the simulation volume, the `compartment_mol`
statement places molecules randomly in a given compartment, and the
`surface_mol` statement places molecules with random or specific
positions on a given surface. In the last case, the molecule state needs
to be specified. In the example file, the statement `surface_mol 100
E(front) membrane all all` instructs Smoldyn to place 100 enzyme
molecules onto the membrane surface in their front state, and that these
molecules should be placed randomly on all panel shapes and all panels
of those shapes (which, in this case, was only one panel).

### Output and Commands

Smoldyn supports a few general output statements. One of those is
`text_display`, which can display the time and molecule counts to the
graphical output window. Other output statements can save TIFF files of
the graphical output for recording snapshots of the simulation or
complete movies.

Commands are also useful for output, and for many other things. These
run-time commands can be thought of as a virtual experimenter who has
permission to manipulate or observe the simulated system in a wide
variety of ways. Whereas the rest of the simulation is supposed to be
physically accurate, there are no such restrictions for commands.

If commands are used to output text to files, then Smoldyn needs to know
what those files are beforehand, which is the purpose of the
`output_files` statement. If those files already exist, then Smoldyn
checks with the user first before overwriting them. To suppress this
warning, run Smoldyn with a `-w` option on the command line (e.g.
`smoldyn template.txt -w`).

Each command is entered with the same general format. They start with
`cmd`, list the times when the command should be executed, give the
name of the specific command, and then give the parameters of that
command. For example, `cmd B molcountheader templateout.txt` indicates
that the command should be run before the simulation starts, the command
is `molcountheader` (which writes out a list of the species names), and
the command should send its output to the file templateout.txt.
Similarly, `cmd N 10 molcount templateout.txt` indicates that the
command should be run every 10 time steps, the command is molcount
(which counts the molecules of each species), and the command should
also send its output to templateout.txt.

Smoldyn supports quite a lot of commands, all of which are listed in the second
half of the reference section, at the back of this manual.

In this particular example file, note the use of the `ifdefine TEXTOUTPUT`
statement. This is used to easily turn on or turn off text output by commenting
the `define TEXTOUTPUT` statement at the top of the file.

### Conclusions

This chapter has presented most of what you know to read and write Smoldyn
input files. If you have not done so already, I recommend stopping here and
experimenting with Smoldyn. At a minimum, it is helpful to edit and run some of
the example files. Ideally, this is a good time to copy an example file into
your own directory and then completely rewrite it to create your own model. As
you go along, refer to the reference section for the details of how specific
statements and commands work. Also, read other chapters in this manual as
questions arise.

If you start using Smoldyn for actual research, then it is important that you
understand what the software is actually doing. It is also helpful to learn
about Smoldyn’s more advanced features, how to automate simulations, and what
makes simulations fast or slow. The rest of this manual addresses these topics.

## The Configuration File

This is the first of the chapters that focuses on a specific aspect of Smoldyn,
in this case the configuration or input file. These chapters are arranged with
more elementary material first and more advanced material afterwards.

### Runtime flags

When starting Smoldyn from the command line, you can follow the filename with
runtime flags, of which the options are listed below. Any combination of flags
may be used, and in any order.

command Smoldyn

<span class="underline">line query result</span>

| Command line | Smoldyn Query  |  Result |
|------|-------|----------------------|
|      | `-` | normal: parameters displayed and simulation run |
| `-o` | `o` | suppress output: text output files are not opened |
| `-p` | `p` | parameters only: simulation is not run |
| `-q` | `q` | quiet: parameters are not displayed |
| `-t` | `t` | text only: no graphics are displayed |
| `-V` | `V` | display version number and quit |
| `-v` | `v` | verbose: extra parameter information is displayed |
| `-w` | `w` | suppress warnings: no warnings are shown |
| `--define x=y` | | set a text macro definition |

## Configuration file syntax

Configuration files, such as bounce3.txt, are simple text files. The format is
a series of text lines, each of which needs to be less than 256 characters
long. On each line of input, the first word describes which parameters are
being set, while the rest of the line lists those parameters, separated by
spaces. If Smoldyn encounters a problem with a line, it displays an error
message and terminates. Possible problems include missing parameters, illegal
parameter values, too many parameters, unrecognized molecule, surface, or
reaction names, unrecognized statements, or others.

In most cases, statements may be entered in any order, although some are
required to be listed after others. The required sequence is not always
obvious, so it is usually easiest to just try what seems most reasonable and
then fix any errors that Smoldyn reports. Also, a few instructions can only be
entered once, whereas others can be entered multiple times.  If a parameter is
entered more than once, the latter value overwrites the prior one. Parameters
that are not defined in the configuration file are assigned default values.

### Variables and formulas

Smoldyn supports numeric variables. Set them using the variable statement, such
as `variable x = 100` (spaces are required here). Also, essentially all numeric
inputs can be entered with a formula. For example, if you want a reaction rate
to be two times the value of x, enter it as `2*x` (spaces are not allowed
within formulas). Smoldyn’s formula processing supports arithmetic
(`+`,`-`,`*`,`/`), modulo division (`%`), powers (`^`), and all levels of
parentheses. It also supports many standard functions, such as `exp`, `sin`,
`sqrt`, etc.

### Statements about the configuration file

A few statements control the reading of the configuration file, which are now
described in more detail. The first, shown in the first line of `bounce3.txt`,
is a comment. A `#` symbol indicates that the remainder of the line should be
ignored, whether it is the whole line as it is in `bounce3.txt` or just the end
of the line. It is also possible to comment out entire blocks of the
configuration file using `/*` to start a block-comment and `*/` to end it. For
these, the `/*` or `*/` symbol combinations are each required to be at the
beginning of configuration file lines. The remainder of those lines is ignored,
along with any lines between them.

It is possible to separate configuration files into multiple text files.  This
is done with the statement read_file, which simply instructs Smoldyn to
continue reading from some other file until that one ends with end_file, which
is followed by more reading of the original file.  The read_file statement may
be used anywhere in the configuration file, including within reaction
definition and surface definition blocks (described below) and within files
that were themselves called with a read_file statement. The configuration file
`examples/S2_config/config.txt` illustrates these statements.

### Text substitution macros

You can use define statements to instruct Smoldyn to perform simple text
substitution as it reads in a configuration file. As a typical example,
you might define your reaction rate constants at the top of a
configuration file using define statements (e.g. `define k1 100`) and then
use the key later on in the file rather than the actual number. This
leads to a file that is more readable and easier to modify. One
definition is set automatically: `FILEROOT` is replaced by the current
file name, without path information and without any text that follows a
`.`. Prior definitions are overwritten with new ones without causing
errors or warnings. These definitions have local scope, meaning that
they only lead to text replacement within the current configuration
file, and not to those that it reads with `read_file`. To create a
definition with broader scope, use define_global; the scope of these
definitions is throughout the current configuration file, as well as any
file or sub-file that is called by the current file. A configuration
file that calls the current one is not affected by a `define_global`. To
remove a definition, or all definitions, use `undefine`.

`define` statements can also be used for conditional configuration file
reading. In this case, a definition is made as usual, although there is no need
to specify any substitution text. Later on in the file, the `ifdefine`, `else`,
and `endif` statements lead to reading of different portions of file, depending
on whether the definition was made or not. A variant of the `ifdefine`
statement is the `ifundefine` statement. These conditional statements should
work as expected if they are used in a normal sort of manner (see any
programming book for basic conditional syntax), which includes support for
nested `if` statements. They can also be used successfully with highly abnormal
syntaxes (for example, an else toggles reading on or off, regardless of the
presence of any preceding `ifdefine` or `ifundefine`), although this use is
discouraged since it will lead to confusing configuration files, as well as
files that may not be compatible with future Smoldyn releases.

Text substitution can also be directed from the command line. If you include
the command line option `--define`, followed by text of the form
`key=replacement` (do not include spaces, although if you want spaces within
the replacement text, then enclose it in double quotes), this is equivalent to
declaring text substitution using the define_global statement within a
configuration file. For example, to the file `cmdlinedefine.txt` includes the
macro key `RDIFC` but does not define it.  To run this file, define the macro
key on the command line like

```bash
$ smoldyn examples/S2_config/cmdlinedefine.txt --define RDIFC=5
```

This feature simplifies running multiple simulations through a shell
script. Essentially any number of definitions can be made this way. If
the same key text is defined both on the command line and in the
configuration file, the former takes priority.

### Running multiple simulations using scripts

It is often useful to simulations over and over again, whether to collect
statistics, to look for rare events, or to scan over parameter ranges. This is
easily accomplished by writing a short Python script, or a script in some other
high level language such as R, MatLab, Mathematica, etc. The following Python
script is at `S2_config/pyscript.py`. It runs the file `paramscan.txt` several
times using different parameter values, with results sent to the standard
output and also saved to different files.

```python
# A python script for scanning a parameter

import os
simnum=0
for rxnrate in [0.01,0.02,0.05,0.1,0.2,0.5,1]:
    simnum+=1
    string='smoldyn paramscan.txt --define RXNRATE=%f --define SIMNUM=%i -tqw' %(rxnrate,simnum)
    print(string)
    os.system(string)
```

Run this script by entering `$ python pyscript.txt`.

Another method for running batches of simulations is for your script to
generate a Smoldyn-readable text file with the appropriate parameters,
say with the file name myparams.txt. Then, in your master Smoldyn file,
which might also be called from the same script, include the line
`read_file myparams.txt`, which reads in the necessary parameters.

### Summary

The following table summarizes the statements that deal with the configuration
file.

| statement | meaning  |

## Space and Time

### Space

Smoldyn simulations can be run in a system that is 1, 2, or
3-dimensional. These can be useful for accurate simulations of systems
that naturally have these dimensions. For example, a 2-dimensional
system can be useful for investigating diffusional dynamics and
interactions of transmembrane proteins. Smoldyn does not permit 4 or
more dimensional systems because it is not clear that they would be
useful. Define the system dimensionality with the dim statement, which
needs to be one of the first statements in a configuration file.

Along with the system dimensionality, it is necessary to specify the
outermost boundaries of the system. In most cases, it is best to design
the simulation so that all molecules stay within the system boundaries,
although this is not required. All simulation processes are performed
outside of the system boundaries exactly as they are within the
boundaries. Boundaries are used by Smoldyn to allow efficient simulation
and for scaling the graphical display. They are typically defined with
the boundaries statement, as seen in the example `S1_intro/bounce3.txt`.
Boundaries may be reflective, transparent, absorbing, or periodic.
Reflective means that all molecules that diffuse into a boundary will be
reflected back into the system. Transparent, which is the default type,
means that molecules just diffuse through the boundary as though it
weren’t there. With absorbing boundaries, any molecule that touches a
boundary is immediately removed from the system. Finally, with periodic
boundaries, which are also called wrap-around or toroidal boundaries,
any molecule that diffuses off of one side of space is instantly moved
to the opposite edge of space; these are useful for simulating a small
portion of a large system while avoiding edge effects.

On rare occasion, it might be desirable to have asymmetric system
boundary types. For example, one side of a system might be reflective
while the other is absorbing. To accomplish this, use the low_wall and
high_wall statements instead of a boundary statement. This is
illustrated in the example file `S3_space/bounds1.txt`.

These boundaries of the entire system are different from surfaces, which
are described below. However, they have enough in common that Smoldyn
does not work well with both at once. Thus, **if any surfaces are used,
the system boundaries will always behave as though the types are
transparent, whether they are defined that way or not**. Thus, if there
are surfaces, it is usually best to use the boundaries statement without
a type parameter, which will lead to the default transparent type. To
account for the transparent boundaries, an outside surface may be needed
that keeps molecules within the system. The one exception to these
suggestions arises for systems with both surfaces and periodic boundary
conditions. To accomplish this with the maximum accuracy, set the
boundary types to periodic (although they will behave as though they are
transparent) and create jump type surfaces, described below, at each
outside edge that send molecules to the far sides. The reason for
specifying that the boundaries are periodic is that they will then allow
bimolecular reactions that occur with one molecule on each side of the
system. This will probably yield a negligible improvement in results,
but nevertheless removes a potential artifact. This is illustrated in
the example `S3_space/bounds2.txt`.

### Time

A simulation runs for a fixed amount of simulated time, using constant
length time steps. The simulation starting time is set with time_start
and the stopping time is set with time_stop. For simulations that are
interrupted and then continued, the time_now statement allows the
initial time to be set to a value that is intermediate between the
starting and stopping times.

The size of the time step is set easily enough with time_step, although
knowing what value to use is an art. Smoldyn always becomes more
accurate, and runs more slowly, as shorter time steps are used. Thus, an
important rule for picking a time step size is to compare the results
that are produced for one value with those produced with a time step
that is half as long; if the results are identical, within stochastic
noise, then the longer time step value is adequate. If not, then a
smaller time step needs to be used.

As an initial guess for what time step to use, time steps can be chosen
from the spatial resolution that is required. The average displacement
of a molecule, which has diffusion coefficient *D*, during one time step
is *s* = (2*D*∆*t*)<sup>1/2</sup>, where ∆*t* is the time step. Turning
this around, to achieve spatial resolution of *s*, the time step needs
to obey

where *D<sub>max</sub>* is the diffusion coefficient of the fastest
diffusing species. The overall spatial resolution for a simulation,
which is the largest rms step length, is displayed in the `molecule
parameters` section of the configuration file diagnostics output. For
good accuracy, the spatial resolution should be significantly smaller
than geometric features or than radii of curvature, for curved objects.

Other considerations for choosing the time step are the characteristic
time scales of the unimolecular and bimolecular reactions. For good
accuracy, the time step should generally be significantly shorter than
the characteristic time scale of any reaction. Using *k* as the reaction
rate constants, unimolecular and bimolecular reactions lead to the
respective time step constraints

The latter equation is for the reaction `A + B → products`. These values
are displayed in the `reaction parameters` section of the configuration
file diagnostics output. While the time scale for unimolecular reactions
is independent of concentrations, the time scale for bimolecular
reactions clearly depends on concentrations. Thus, the time scale that
is displayed for bimolecular reactions is only a rough guide at best; it
does not account for the changing concentrations of the reactants nor
for local variations in concentrations.

As an initial guess, the time step that is chosen should be the smallest
of those that are suggested here for all of these processes. Afterwards,
it is usually worth running several trial simulations with longer or
shorter time steps to see what the longest time step is that still
yields sufficiently accurate results.

### Summary of statements that define space and time

The following table summarizes the statements for defining space and
time.

| statement | function |
|----------|-----------------------------------|
| `dim dim` | system dimensionality: 1, 2, or 3 |
| `boundaries dim pos1 pos2` | system boundaries on dimension dim |
| `boundaries dim pos1 pos2 type` | same, for systems without surfaces |
| `low_wall dim pos type` | specify single low-side boundary |
| `high_wall dim pos type` | specify single high-side boundary |
| `time_start time` | starting time of simulation |

| `time_step time` | time step for the simulation |
| `time_now time` | current time of the simulation |


### Technical discussion of time steps

A major focus of the design of Smoldyn has been to make it so that results are
indistinguishable from those that would be obtained if the simulated time
increased continuously. This goal cannot be achieved perfectly. Instead, the
algorithms are written so that the simulation approaches the Smoluchowski
description of reaction-diffusion systems as the time step is reduced towards
zero. Also, it maintains as much accuracy as possible for longer time steps.
This topic is discussed in detail in the research paper [Stochastic simulation
of chemical reactions with spatial resolution and single molecule
detail](https://doi.org/10.1088/1478-3967/1/3/001) by *Steven Andrews* and
*Dennis Bray* (*Physical Biology* 1:137-151, 2004).

In concept, the system is observed at a fixed time, then it evolves to
some new state, then it is observed again, and so forth. This leads to
the following sequence of program operations:

```text
--------------- time = *t* ---------------
observe and manipulate system
graphics are drawn
molecules diffuse
desorption and surface-state transitions
surface or boundary interactions
reactions
0th order reactions
1st order reactions
2nd order reactions
reaction products are added to system
surface interactions of reaction products
------------- time = *t* + ∆*t* -------------
```

After commands are run, graphics are displayed to OpenGL if that is
enabled. The evolution over a finite time step starts by diffusing all
mobile molecules. In the process, some end up across internal surfaces
or the external boundary. These are reflected, transmitted, absorbed, or
transported as needed. Next, reactions are treated in a semi-synchronous
fashion. They are asynchronous in that all zeroth order reactions are
simulated first, then unimolecular reactions, and finally bimolecular
reactions. With bimolecular reactions, if a molecule is within the
binding radii of two different other molecules, then it ends up reacting
with only the first one that is checked, which is arbitrary (but not
necessarily random). Reactions are synchronous in that reactants are
removed from the system as soon as they react and products are not added
into the system until all reactions have been completed. This prevents
reactants from reacting twice during a time step and it prevents
products from one reaction from reacting again during the same time
step. As it is possible for reactions to produce molecules that are
across internal surfaces or outside the system walls, those products are
then reflected back into the system. At this point, the system has fully
evolved by one time step. All molecules are inside the system walls and
essentially no pairs of molecules are within their binding radii (the
exception is that products of a bimolecular reaction with an unbinding
radius might be initially placed within the binding radius of another
reactant).

Each of the individual routines that is executed during a time step
exactly produces the results of the Smoluchowski description, or yields
kinetics that exactly match those that were requested by the user.
However, the simulation is not exact for all length time steps because
it cannot exactly account for interactions between the various
phenomena. For example, if a system was simulated that only had
unimolecular reactions and the products of those reactions did not
react, then the simulation would yield exactly correct results using any
length time step. However, if the products could react, then there would
be interactions between reactions and there would be small errors. In
this case, the error arises because Smoldyn does not allow a molecule to
be in existence for less than the length of one time step.


## Molecules

### About molecules

In Smoldyn, each individual molecule is represented as a separate
point-like particle. These particles have no volume, so they do not
collide with each other when they are simply diffusing (however, see
`excluded volume reactions` in the reactions section, below, which can
give molecules excluded volume). Because of the rapid collisions that
occur for solvated molecules, both rotational correlations and momentum
correlations damp out rapidly in most biochemical systems, so
orientations and momenta are ignored in Smoldyn as well.

Each molecule has a molecular species. Enter the names for these species
with the species statement. You can refer to these species by the same
names afterwards, or you can refer to multiple species at a time using
either wildcard symbols or by defining species groups.

Each molecule is allowed to exist in any of five states: 

1. not bound to any surface (called solution state), 
2. bound to the front of a surface, 
3. bound to the back of a surface,
4. bound across a surface in the `up` direction, or 
5. bound across a surface in the `down` direction. 

While the surface-bound states are intended to represent specific molecule
attachments to membranes, they can also be used for other purposes; for
example, you can specify that a trans-membrane protein is normally in its `up`
state, but that it’s in its `down` state when it is in a lipid raft.

Molecules that are not bound to surfaces are added with the mol statement. This
is a reasonably versatile statement in that, on each axis, it allows molecules
to be placed randomly within the simulation volume, randomly within some
smaller region, or at a specific location.  The surface_mol statement is used
to add molecules that are bound to surfaces, although it cannot be entered in
the configuration file until the appropriate surface has been set up.
Similarly, compart_mol is used to add molecules to compartments, which are
regions between surfaces, but it also cannot be entered until more things have
been set up. The statements about molecules mentioned thus far, with the
exception of the last two, are shown in either `S1_intro/bounce3.txt` or
`S4_molecules/molecule.txt`.

### Diffusion

Molecules in Smoldyn diffuse according to the diffusion coefficient that
is entered for the appropriate species and state. These coefficients are
entered with the difc statement. Although it has not proven to be
particularly useful, it is also possible for Smoldyn to simulate
anisotropic diffusion, meaning that molecules diffuse more rapidly in
some directions than in others. Anisotropic diffusion is specified with
a diffusion coefficient matrix using the difm statement.

Isotropic diffusion rates were tested quantitatively with the diffi.txt
configuration file. In this file, all molecules start in the center of
space, the boundaries are made transparent so molecules diffuse
completely freely, and red, green, and blue molecules diffuse with
different diffusion coefficients. Using a runtime command in the
configuration file, described below, Smoldyn outputs the moments of the
molecular distributions to text files. They were analyzed with the Excel
file `diffi.xls`, which is also in the `S4_molecules` folder. From this
Excel file, the graphical and numerical results are shown below, along
with theoretical predictions.

![](../media/image5.png){: style="width:300px"}
![](../media/image6.png){: style="width:300px"}
![](../media/image7.png){: style="width:300px"}

The middle panel of the figure shows that the mean position of the red
molecules, on each of the three coordinates, stays near zero although
with fluctuations. This is as expected for free diffusion. The expected
fluctuation size, shown in the panel with light black lines, is given
with

$$|\text{mean} - \text{starting point}| = \sqrt{\frac{2Dt}{n}}$$

where $D$ is the diffusion coefficient, $t$ is the simulation time, and $n$ is
the number of molecules. This equation agrees well with simulation data. The
second moment of the molecule displacements is a matrix quantity which gives
the variance on each pair of axes of the distribution of positions, shown in
the third panel. For example, the variance matrix element for axes $x$ and $y$
is

$$ v_{xy} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i-\bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})$$

The overbars indicate mean values for the distribution. Because diffusion on
different axes is independent, the off-diagonal variances (*v<sub>xy</sub>*,
*v<sub>xz</sub>*, and *v<sub>yz</sub>*) are expected to be about 0, but with
some fluctuations, as is seen in the figure. The diagonal variances
(*v<sub>xx</sub>*, *v<sub>yy</sub>*, and *v<sub>zz</sub>*) are each expected to
increase as approximately

$$v_{xx} ≈ v_{yy} ≈ v_{zz} ≈ 2Dt$$ 

Again, this is seen in the figure. Similar figures for the green and
blue molecules, which are not presented, showed similarly good agreement
between the simulation data and theory.

Anisotropic diffusion was investigated with the example file diffa.txt.
In this case, the diffusion equation is

$$ \dot{u} = ∇ \dot D∇ u$$

Here, $u$ can be interpreted as either the probability density for a
single molecule or as the concentration of a macroscopic collection of
molecules, and $D$ is the diffusion matrix. $D$ is symmetric. **The
matrix that is entered in the configuration file for anisotropic
diffusion, using the `difm` statement, is the square root of the diffusion
matrix** because the square root is much more convenient for calculating
expectation molecule displacements. Matrix square roots can be
calculated with MatLab, Mathematica, or other methods. Note that the
symmetric property of $D$ implies some symmetry properties for its
square root as well (for example, a symmetric square root leads to a
symmetric $D$). If $D$ is diagonal, the square root of the matrix is
found by simply replacing each element with its square root. If $D$ is
equal to the identity matrix times a constant, $D$, the equation reduces
to the standard isotropic diffusion equation. The example file diffa.txt
illustrates the use of the difm statement; the relevant lines are

```
difm red 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2
difm green 1 2 3 2 0 4 3 4 1
```

The former line leads to anisotropic diffusion of red molecules with a
diffusion coefficient of 1 on the *x*-axis, 0 on the *y*-axis, and 4 on
the *z*-axis. The latter leads to anisotropic diffusion with
off-diagonal components. This matrix is interpreted to be

$$\sqrt{D} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\
    2 & 0 & 4 \\
    3 & 4 & 1 
    \end{bmatrix}$$

Results are shown below

![](../media/image13.png){: style="width:300px"}
![](../media/image14.png){: style="width:300px"}
![](../media/image15.png){: style="width:300px"}

In the figure, it can be seen that the red molecules diffuse only on the
*x*-*z*-plane, whereas the green molecules diffuse into an elliptical
pattern that is not aligned with the axes. The red molecule data are
graphed, where it is shown that *x*-values diffuse slowly, *y*-values
don’t diffuse at all, and *z*-values diffuse rapidly. The means and
variances agree well with theory.

### Drift

In addition to diffusion, molecules can drift, meaning that they move
with a fixed speed and in a fixed direction. Up to version 2.26, drift
could only be defined relative to the global system coordinates. For
this method, which is supported in subsequent versions as well, enter
the drift rate using the drift statement, followed by the velocity
vector. Surface-bound molecules drift as well, although they are
constrained to surfaces, so their actual velocity depends on the overlap
of the drift vector and the surface orientation (e.g. a molecule’s
velocity is zero if the local surface is perpendicular to the drift
vector and it equals the drift vector if that vector can lie within the
the local surface orientation).

New in version 2.27, surface-bound molecules can also drift relative to
the coordinates of their surface panel. Specify this with the
surface_drift statement. For a 2-D system, surfaces are 1-D objects, so
the surface-bound drift vector is a single number. It is the drift rate
along `rectangles,` `triangles,` `spheres,` etc., all of which are
really just different shape lines. For a 3-D system, surfaces are 2-D
objects, so the surface-bound drift vector includes two values, which
generally use the most obvious orthogonal coordinates for each panel
shape. For a cylinder, for example, the former number is the drift rate
parallel to the cylinder axis and the latter is the drift rate around
the cylinder. A possible use of surface-bound drift would be to simulate
molecular motor motion along a cylinder that represents a microtubule.

### Molecule lists

From a user’s point of view, Smoldyn molecules follow a Western life
trajectory: some chemical reaction causes a new molecule to be born from
nothing, it diffuses around in space for a while, and then it undergoes
a reaction and vanishes again into nothingness (or maybe goes to
molecule heaven). Internally though, the situation is closer to a Wheel
of Life: there are a fixed number of molecules that cycle indefinitely
between `live` and `dead` states and which are assigned a new species
type at each reincarnation. The dead molecule list is of no importance
to the functioning of the simulation, but merely stores molecules when
they are not currently active in the simulated system. The size and
current population of the dead list are displayed in the molecule
section of the configuration file diagnostics if you choose verbose
output.

Active molecules in a simulation are stored in one or more live lists.
As a default, all live molecules that diffuse, meaning that the
diffusion coefficient is non-zero, are stored in a list called
`diffuselist` while all fixed molecules are stored in a separate live
list called `fixedlist.` The separation of the molecules into these two
lists speeds up the simulation because all molecules in fixedlist can be
safely ignored during diffusion calculations or surface checking.

Additional live lists can be beneficial as well. For example, consider
the equilibrium chemical reaction $A + B ↔ C$.

The only bimolecular reaction possible is between A and B molecules, so
there is no need to check each and every A-A, B-B, A-C, B-C, and C-C
molecule pair as well to look for more possible reactions. In this case,
storing A, B, and C molecules in three separate lists means that
potential A-B reactions can be checked without having to scan over all
of the other combinations too. This is done in the example file
`S4_molecules/mollist.txt`, where it is found that using three molecule
lists for A, B, and C leads to a simulation that runs 30% faster than
using just one molecule list. With a Michaelis-Menten reaction, the
difference was found to be closer to a 4-fold improvement.

While it might seem best to have one molecule list per molecular
species, it is not quite so simple. It is often the case in biology
modeling that many chemical species will exist at very low copy number.
In particular, a protein that can bind any of several ligands needs to
be defined as separate molecular species for each possible combination
of bound and unbound ligands. This number grows exponentially with the
number of binding sites, leading to a problem called combinatorial
explosion. Because there are so many molecular species, there are
relatively few molecules of each one. Returning to the Smoldyn molecule
lists, each list slows the simulation speed by a small amount. Thus,
adding lists is worthwhile if each list has many molecules in it, but
not if most lists are nearly empty.

At least for the present, Smoldyn does not automatically determine what
set of molecule lists will lead to the most efficient simulation, so it
is up to the user make his or her best guess. Molecule lists are defined
with the statement molecule_lists and molecule species are assigned to
the lists with mol_list. Any molecules that are unassigned with the
mol_list statement are automatically assigned to new a list called
`unassignedlist`.

### Statements about molecules

The following table summarizes the statements about molecules.

| statement | function |
|-------|------------|
| species *name*<sub>1</sub> *name*<sub>2</sub> *… name*<sub>n</sub> | names of species |
| difc *species*(*state*) *value* | diffusion coefficient |
| difm *species* (*state*) *m*<sub>0</sub> *m*<sub>1</sub> … *m<sub>dim</sub>*<sub>\**dim*–1</sub> | diffusion matrix |

| molecule_lists *listname<sub>1</sub>* *listname*<sub>2</sub> … | names of molecule lists |
| mol_list *species*(*state*) *listname* | assignment of molecule to a list |

### Wildcards

Most statements that work with molecular species allow you to specify multiple
species using wildcard characters, such as `?` and `*`. A question mark can
represent exactly one character and an asterisk can represent zero or more
characters. For example, if you want protein Fus3 to have a different diffusion
coefficient in the cytoplasm as in the nucleus, you might define it as two
species, Fus3_cyto and Fu3_nucl.  Then, you could specify that they are both
colored red using `color Fus3_* red`.

Smoldyn supports many other wildcards as well. The logical operators are `|`
for OR and `&` for AND, along with braces to enforce an order of operation. Use
the former operator to enumerate a set of options.  Continuing with the above
example, you could specify that both species should be red with
`Fus3_{cyto|nucl}`, where this is now more specific than using the asterisk
wildcard character. Use the ampersand to specify that multiple terms are in a
species name but that the order of the terms is unimportant. For example,
`a&b&c` represents any of the 6 species: abc, acb, bac, bca, cab, and cba. The
‘&’ operator takes precedence over the ‘|’ operator so, for example, `a|b&c`
represents any of: a, bc, and cb. On the other hand, {a|b}&c represents any of:
ac, bc, ca, and cb. The following table summarizes Smoldyn’s wildcard options.

| symbol | meaning | matching example | reaction example |
|--------|---------|------------------|------------------|
| `?` | any 1 character | `A?` matches Ax and Ay | A? + B -> A?B |
|`*` | any 0 or more characters | `A*` matches A, Ax, Axy | A + B* -> AB* |
| `A|B` | either A or B | `A|B` matches A, B | A|B + C -> D |
| `A&B` | either AB or BA | `A&B` matches AB, BA | A&B + C -> D |
| `{}` | order of operation | `A&{B|C}`  matches AB, BA, AC, CA | A&{B|C} -> 0|
| `[ad]` | any 1 character in list `A[ad]` | matches Aa and Ad | A[1-4] -\> B[1-4] |
| `[a-d]` | any 1 character in range | A[ac-e] matches Aa, Ac, Ad, Ae | A[1-4] -> B[1-4] |
| `$n` | n’th match on left side | |  A? + B? -\> C$1C$2 |

### Species groups

You can create your own groups of species by defining species groups.
This allows you to set the properties of multiple species at once. It
also enables the results for multiple species to be added together for
many of the observation commands. Species groups function essentially
identically to groups of species that are designated using wildcard
characters or using the BioNetGen module. Define a species group with
the species_group statement.  

## Graphics

### Graphics display

Graphics are useful for designing and debugging configuration files, for
understanding the results of a simulation, and for communicating
simulation results to others.

Graphical output, and the overall type of graphics, is enabled with the
graphics statement which is included at the beginning of most of the
example files. Smoldyn supports the graphics options: `none`, `opengl`,
`opengl_good`, and `opengl_better`. The `none` option means that no
graphics are displayed, which is convenient for running batches of
quantitative simulations. The `opengl` option shows molecules as small
squares that don’t account for which is in front of others. This is poor
rendering quality but is fast to simulate. The `opengl_good` option
replaces these squares with circles that are a little better looking,
that account for depth-testing, and are much slower to render. Finally,
the `opengl_better` option allows for the placement of light sources,
for molecules to be shiny spheres, and for surfaces to be shiny. This
yields fairly good quality results.

Graphical rendering can be as computationally intensive as the
simulation itself, so it can be prudent to not display the system at
every simulation time step, but only every n’th time step. This is
done with the `graphic_iter` statement. Alternatively, exactly the
opposite may be wanted. It may be that the simulation runs too quickly
for one to understand what’s being shown in the graphics window as it
happens. To slow the simulation down, use the graphic_delay statement.

If you use the graphical output, then Smoldyn does not stop when the
simulation is complete, but it instead lets you continue manipulating
the graphics. When you are done, press ‘Q’ (shift and ‘q’ key). You can
also stop using command-q, but that is less good because it forces
Smoldyn to quit immediately rather than simply telling Smoldyn to finish
its tasks (such as closing files and freeing memory) and then quit. If
you want Smoldyn to stop as soon as the simulation is complete, use the
quit_at_end statement.

The graphical display can be manipulated during the simulation using the
keyboard. These keys and their actions are listed in the table shown below.
Note that it is possible to rotate the system about either the viewing axes
with the arrow keys, or about the object axes with the `x`, `y`, and `z` keys.

 Key press | dimensions | function 
-----------|------------|----------
space | 1,2,3 | toggle pause mode between on and off
Q  | 1,2,3 | quit
T | 1,2,3 | save image as TIFF file
0 | 1,2,3 | reset view to default
arrows | 3 | rotate object
shift + arrows | 1,2,3 | pan object
= | 1,2,3 | zoom in
- | 1,2,3 | zoom out
x,y,z | 3 | rotate counterclockwise about object axis
X,Y,Z | 3 | rotate clockwise about object axis

### Drawing the system

Several statements control the drawing of the system. The background
color is set with background_color, the system boundaries are drawn
with the line thickness that is set with frame_thickness and the color
that is set with frame_color. Although the feature is usually turned
off, the grid_thickness and grid_color statements can be used to
display the virtual boxes into which the system is divided (see the
optimization section). Molecules are drawn with a size that is set with
display_size and a color set with color. All of the statements that set
colors require either color words chosen from the table below, or
numbers for the red, green, and blue color channels. Regarding the
molecule display size, dimensions are in pixels if the output style is
just `opengl` and are in the same length units are used in the rest of
the configuration file if the output style is `opengl_good`.

## Colors

Colors can be entered with color coordinates or names. Color coordinates
are for the red, green and blue channels, with each value ranging
between 0 (fully off) and 1 (fully on). Surfaces also allow a fourth
color channel, the alpha channel, which is the surface opacity. Here, a
value of 0 indicates a transparent surface and 1 indicates an opaque
surface. Smoldyn does not support this feature very well, so it’s
generally best to stick with opaque surfaces.

The following table lists the available color names.

|       |          |          |          |
|---------|------------|------------|-------------|
| maroon  | olive      | royal      | darkred    |
| red     | green      | sky        | darkorange |
| scarlet | chartrouse | aquamarine | darkyellow |
| rose    | khaki      | violet     | darkgreen  |
| brick   | purple     | mauve      | darkblue    |   
| pink    | magenta    | orchid     | darkviolet  |

### Text display to the graphics window

A few text items can be written to the graphics window during the
simulation, all of which are displayed in the upper left corner of the
graphics window. These are the simulation time and the numbers of
different molecular species in the simulation. Use the text_color and
text_display statements to control this output.

### TIFF files and movies

Graphical images may be saved as TIFF images that are copied from the
graphical display. Thus, the saved image size and resolution are the
same as they are on the screen. A single snapshot can be saved during a
simulation by pressing ‘T’ (uppercase). As a default it is saved as
`OpenGL001.tiff`, which will be in the same file folder as the
configuration file. Alternatively, the configuration file statements
tiff_name can be used to set the basic name of the file (a name of
`picture` will end up being saved as `picture001.tiff`). The numerical
suffix of the name can be set with tiff_min and tiff_max. The
tiff_max value can be set to arbitrarily large numbers, although
reasonable values are recommended so that vast numbers of useless tiff
files can’t be saved by accident.

A sequence of TIFF files can be saved automatically with the tiff_iter
statement, allowing one to save an image sequence for later compilation
into a movie. TIFF files can also be saved automatically with the
keypress T command, which allows more versatile timing than the
tiff_iter statement. Compiling an image sequence into a movie is easy
with Apple’s QuickTime Pro or with various other programs.

### Summary of basic graphics statements

The following images show Smoldyn’s graphics for 1D, 2D, and 3D systems,
made with the files graphics1.txt, graphics2.txt, and graphics3.txt. All
of these use the `opengl_good` graphics quality.

The following table lists the graphics statements

### Better graphics

Smoldyn’s better graphics, selected with the graphics opengl_better
statement, are intended to be adequate for publication-quality figures.
With them, you can define a `room` light and up to 8 point lights. The
room light is non-directional. Define its color with the ambient option.
Each point light has a position and then colors for its ambient light,
diffuse light, and specular light. To make the light position as a
3-dimensional point in space, enter 4 values for the position, and make
the last value equal to 1. Alternatively, you can make the light
directional but not arising from a specific position. To do this, keep
all of the x, y, and z values between 0 and 1, and set the 4th value to
0. Ambient light is non-directional and does not reflect off of a
surface. Diffuse light is directional (from the light source) but lights
the illuminated side of a surface evenly, as though it is a non-shiny
surface. Specular light is also directional and reflects off of a
surface as though it is shiny.

Within each surface block, you can set the shininess of the surface with
the shininess statement.

## Runtime commands

### Command basics

The design of a simulation can be broken down into two portions. One
portion represents the physical system, including its boundaries,
surfaces, molecules, and chemical reactions. These are the core
components of Smoldyn and are simulated by the main program. The other
portion represents the action of the experimenter, which include
observations and manipulations of the system. As with the parameters of
the physical system, these actions are also listed in the configuration
file. They are listed as a series of commands and execution times.

There are no rules regarding what commands can and cannot do. Thus, in
principle, commands could be used to measure any aspect of the simulated
system at any time. Or, other commands could be used to manipulate any
aspect of the system, regardless of whether the manipulations have any
physical basis. In practice, there is a limited set of commands that
have been written (listed below in the reference section) so the range
of what can actually be done with commands is limited to what those in
this list can do. Alternatively, a somewhat adventurous user can write
his or her own source code to create a new command, as explained below.
Because commands do not have to follow the rules that the rest of the
code does, they are easy to add and are powerful, but they also tend to
be less stable and less well optimized than the core program.

Commands are entered in a configuration file with the statement cmd,
followed by some information about the execution timing, the specific
command name, and finally any parameters for the command. Here are some
examples:

```
cmd b pause
cmd e ifno ATP stop
cmd n 100 molcount outfile.txt
```

The first one instructs the simulation to pause before it starts
running, the second says that the simulation should stop if there are no
molecules named ATP, and the third tells Smoldyn to print a count of all
molecules to the file called outfile.txt every 100 iterations. In
contrast to the statements that define the physical system, runtime
commands are not parsed or interpreted until the simulation time when
they are supposed to be executed. When a command is executed, Smoldyn
processes it with a runtime command interpreter. If there are errors in
command parameters, such as a missing or nonsensical parameter, these
are not caught until the command is executed during the simulation.

Command execution timing works in either of two ways. A command can be
performed at real-valued simulation times, such as before the simulation
starts, at some particular time, or repeatedly at fixed time intervals.
Alternatively, a command can be performed after some specified number of
time steps. This avoids minor timing problems that can arise from
round-off error. Commands for these two methods are stored in the
continuous-time and integer command queues, respectively. If two
commands are entered with the exact same timing instructions, then, at
each invocation, they are performed in the same order as they are listed
in the configuration file. On the other hand, the order may differ if
their timing instructions differ; to be precise, they are executed in
the order from the one that was least recently performed to the one that
was most recently performed. If both integer and continuous time queue
commands are supposed to execute at the same time step, then all of
integer queue commands are performed first. Command timing is
demonstrated with the configuration files S6_commands/cmdtime1.txt and
S6_commands/cmdtime2.txt.

The following table shows the command timing options.

#### continuous time queue

code  | parameters     | execution timing
----- | ------------   | -------------------
b     |                | runs once, before simulation starts
a     |                | runs once, after simulation ends
@     | *time*         | runs once, at ≥ *time*
i     | *on off dt*    | runs every *dt*, from ≥ *on* until ≤ *off*
x     | *on off dt xt* | geometric progression

#### integer queue

code  | parameters     | execution timing
----- | ------------   | ------------------
B     |                | runs once, before simulation starts
A     |                | runs once, after simulation ends
&     | *i*            | runs once, at iteration *i*
I     | *oni offi dti* | runs every *dti* iteration, from ≥ *oni* to ≤ *offi*
E     |                | run every time step
N     | *n*            | runs every *n* time steps

A few deprecated codes, which are in addition to the codes listed above,
are that j is equivalent to I, e is equivalent to E, and n is equivalent
to N. Although these are deprecated, they are commonly used, so they
will probably be supported indefinitely.

Each command is one of three main types: control, observe, or
manipulate. Control commands control the simulation operation. For
example, a command called keypress, followed by a letter, causes the
simulation to act as though that key had been pressed by the user. This
can be useful for modifying the display automatically. Observation
commands read information from the simulation data structures, analyze
the data some, and output results to text files. The precison of
numerical output values can be set using the output_precision
statement. Neither control nor observation commands modify any aspect of
the simulation. Manipulation commands modify the simulation parameters,
such as the addition, removal, or replacement of molecules, or the
modification of reaction rate constants. These commands do not produce
any output. Yet a fourth type of command is the conditional command.
These test for certain simulation conditions, such as there being more
than some number of some molecule species, and then run a second command
if the conditions are met. Each conditional command is characterized as
being one of the three main types based on the type of its second
command.

### Output format and files

Most observation commands output a series of data values. The default
format is `ssv`, which is space-separated vectors. These are easy for a
person to read but are not as convenient when using most software. Thus,
you can also use the output_format statement to specify that you want
`csv` output, which are comma-separated vectors.

For observation commands to work, one typically needs to declare the
output file names with the statements output_files or append_files.
The exception to this is if output should go to the standard output or
standard error location, which are typically the terminal window. These
are called `stdout` and `stderr`, respectively, exactly as in C or C++.
These can be declared with the output_files statement but don’t need to
be.

To save output files in a subdirectory, the subdirectory path is
declared with the output_root statement. Note that the path needs to
end with a ‘/’, if you’re working on a Mac or Linux system, or ‘\\’ for
Windows. This subdirectory path is concatenated on the end of the path
that was used for the configuration file. It is possible to save a stack
of files in which there is a separate file for each of many sequential
observations. These are created with the output_file_number statement,
which defines the starting suffix number for the file stack. Zero, which
is the default, indicates no suffix number, whereas other numbers lead
to a 3 digit suffix. The suffix number is incremented with the command
incrementfile. The complete output filename is a concatenation of: the
path for the configuration file, the string declared with output_root,
the file name declared with output_files minus any suffix that starts
with a ‘.’, an underscore and the suffix number declared with
output_file_number, and finally any suffix that starts with a ‘.’.
Here is an example, using Mac and Linux path notation:

```
working directory:      theory
configuration file:     theory/expt1/myconfig.txt
desired output files:   theory/expt1/results/outfile_001.txt
                        theory/expt1/results/outfile_002.txt
                        ...

configuration file excerpt:
    output_root results/
    output_files outfile.txt
    output_file_number outfile.txt 1
    cmd n 100 incrementfile outfile.txt
    cmd e molcount outfile.txt

starting Smoldyn: smoldyn expt1/myconfig.txt
```

Because of the potential for confusion with output file names, complete
pathnames (relative to the working directory) are displayed at start-up
with the simulation parameters.

An example that is essentially identical to the one shown above is in
given in the example file S6_commands/cmdfile.txt. Upon running it and
looking at the results, you will discover that the first output file,
cmdfileout_001.txt, is empty, whereas all of the others are full, as
expected. The empty file arises because the file number is incremented
at the very beginning, before the molcount command is invoked for the
first time. This could be remedied by using slightly more sophisticated
command timing with the ‘i’ or ‘j’ timing codes.

### Specific commands

All of the commands are listed below in the reference section, which is
the definitive source of information about them. Most of the commands
are also demonstrated in the example files S6_commands/cmdobserve.txt
and S6_commands/cmdmanipulate.txt. Of the full list of commands, some
are quite useful, some are rarely used, and some have been superceded by
newer code. The last category includes several that implement
rudimentary reflecting surfaces, which were written before a good
treatment of surfaces was added to the core program. Of the more useful
commands, a few deserve special mention.

The molcount command, and several variations of it, are used to save the
numbers of each kind of molecule as a function of time. These are often
the most useful text output commands from Smoldyn.

The savesim command causes the entire simulation state to be saved to a
file as a configuration file that can be read by Smoldyn. With it, one
can save a simulation mid-run and then continue running it later. This
can be useful as a backup for intermediate results or for building
starting states for complex simulations in several stages.

The keypress command creates an event that the program responds to, as
though the user had pressed this key. For example, at the end of a
simulation that uses graphics, the graphics window is left on the screen
until the user selects quit from the menu or presses ‘Q’. This quitting
can also be programmed into the configuration file with `cmd a keypress
Q`. Arrows and other keypress options can be entered as well.

The set command enables you to enter essentially any configuration file
statement mid-simulation. For example, the command `set species green`
creates the species named `green` when the command is invoked, rather
than at the beginning of the simulation. It’s also possible to create
surfaces, add reactions, etc. mid-simulation.

## Surfaces

### Surface basics

A large fraction of biochemistry does not happen in free solution, but
at or across cellular membranes. To model these interactions, Smoldyn
supports surfaces within the simulation volume. Typically, one Smoldyn
surface is used to model each type of membrane. For example, a bacterium
might be modeled with one surface for the inner membrane and another for
the outer membrane, while a eukaryotic cell would use separate surfaces
for the plasma membrane, the nuclear membrane, and for each type of
organelle. Smoldyn supports disjoint surfaces as well, such as for a
collection of vesicles.

Each Smoldyn surface comprises many panels. These panels have simple
geometries: for three-dimensional systems, a panel may be a rectangle,
triangle, sphere, cylinder, hemisphere, or a disk. For one- and
two-dimensional systems, lower dimensional analogs of these panel shapes
can be used. There are two main reasons that Smoldyn supports this
variety of primitive shapes rather than just the triangle meshes that
are more common. First, these are much easier to use for simple models.
For example, it is much easier to specify a simple spherical nucleus for
a cell than it is to build an approximate sphere out of 20 or more
triangles. Second, it is faster to simulate molecular collisions with
one sphere or other simple curved objects than with a lot of triangles.
In general, more geometric primitives are better. (Although, from the
Smoldyn programmer’s point of view, each one also requires a significant
amount of math before it can be supported by Smoldyn).

Each surface includes a set of rules that dictate how molecules interact
with it. This includes molecules that diffuse into it from solution, as
well as molecules that are bound to the surface. All panels on a single
surface interact with molecules in the same ways. Molecules that are
bound to a surface are designed to represent membrane-bound proteins and
trans-membrane proteins. For example, they can model signaling receptors
or ion channels.

### Defining surfaces

Surfaces are typically entered with one or more blocks of statements
that start with start_surface and end with end_surface. Between these,
only surface statements are recognized. A single surface may be broken
up into multiple blocks of statements, and each block may describe
multiple surfaces. The surface name may be given after the
start_surface statement, or it can be given afterwards with the name
statement; this specifies which surface is being defined, and starts a
new one if required.

As was mentioned before, Smoldyn surfaces do not work well in
conjunction with the system boundaries that were defined with the
boundaries, low_wall, or high_wall statements. If a configuration file
includes any surface statement, even if no surfaces are actually
defined, then all wall-type boundaries automatically behave as though
they are transparent. To keep molecules within the system, an outermost
surface needs to be defined. It may be a set of rectangular panels that
are coincident with the system walls, a sphere that encloses the system,
or something else. Molecules could also be allowed to escape the system
although that is usually undesirable and can slow the simulation down
(see below for the unbounded_emitter statement, which provides an
efficient alternative to escaping molecules).

The action or rate statements set the rules that molecules follow when
they interact with a surface. For molecules in solution that collide
with one of the surface faces, which are called front and back, there
are three basic actions: reflection off of the surface, transmission
through the surface, or absorption by the surface. It is also possible
for a surface to be a `jumping` surface, such that if a molecule
collides with it in one place, the molecule will be magically
transported to a pre-defined destination. This is described below, as is
another type of special surface called a `porting` surface. Yet another
action option is `multiple`, meaning that there any of several outcomes
are possible and that there are specific rates for each. These rates are
set with the rate statement (if rate is entered, the only possible
action is `multiple`, so the action statement may be omitted). For
example, a membrane might be somewhat permeable to a molecular species,
in which case one would set some rate for transmission; molecules that
are not transmitted are reflected. Using the rate statement, it is also
possible to cause a molecule to change species when it interacts with a
surface. This is designed for molecules that behave sufficiently
differently in different regions of space that it is most convenient to
treat them with two different species; a typical use is for
spatially-dependent diffusion coefficients.

The action and rate statements also apply to collisions of surface-bound
molecules with other surfaces. This can arise when molecules diffuse
along surfaces and two surfaces cross each other. For example, one way
to create a lipid raft is to create a single surface for a cell membrane
and then a short cylinder that intersects the membrane, creating an
inner circular region and an other region (a Gaussian pillbox). Then,
surface-bound molecules change species names when they cross the
cylinder. An exception to the normal behavior arises when a
surface-bound molecule collides with a panel that has been declared to
be a neighbor of the molecule’s panel. In this case, there are two
options, which are selected with the neighbor_action statement. The
default behavior is that the molecule simply ignores the panel and
diffuses through it. Alternatively, the molecule can be allowed to hop
onto the new panel, with a 50% probability of doing so. This latter
possibility is helpful for allowing diffusion on a surface where the
panels don’t necessarily meet at their edges.

Sometimes, one wants a modeled system to be unbounded, such as for the
simulation of pheromones that diffuse freely between cells, but that can
also diffuse away towards infinity. While Smoldyn can simulate such
unbounded systems with unbounded space, this can be very computationally
intensive because it tracks every molecule, no matter how far it is from
the region of interest. A better solution is to define a surface that
surrounds the portion of the system that is of interest, where these
surface panels absorb molecules at a rate that causes the system to
behave as though it were unbounded. Smoldyn calculates this absorption
rate automatically, from information that the user specifies with the
unbounded_emitter statement. This statement declares the positions and
the production rates for each emission source within the simulation
volume. The new absorption coefficients completely replace any other
actions that might be defined for interactions between this surface and
molecular species.

### Defining surface panels

Individual surface panels are defined with one panel statement for each
individual panel. These statements are used to specify panel locations,
dimensions, orientations, and, sometimes, drawing information. Each
panel also has a name, for which the default is simply the panel shape
followed a number, although it is also possible for the name to be
defined by the user at the end of the panel statement. These names are
used for jumping surfaces and diffusion of surface-bound molecules. For
a surface to work in a consistent manner, it is worth making sure that
all panel front sides face the same way. The drawing information, such
as the numbers of slices and stacks for a sphere, is only used for
graphical rendering. As far as the simulation is concerned, a sphere,
regardless of how it is drawn, is always a mathematically perfect
sphere.

In general, panels should not be defined that are coincident with each
other because this can lead to unreliable behavior. The rule is that if
multiple panels are *exactly* coincident, whether they are members of
the same surface or different ones, then only the one that is defined
last in the configuration file is in effect. For example, one could
define a washer-shaped surface using a large disk that reflects all
molecules and a small disk, which has the same center and is parallel to
the large disk, that transmits all molecules. However, computer
round-off error often makes exact coincidence impossible; at best, it is
most likely to work if the panels are parallel to the system axes or if
they share the same center point. If two panels are very nearly but not
exactly coincident (separations between 0 and 10<sup>-12</sup> distance
units), Smoldyn treats them as though they are reflective, which it has
to do in order to prevent unintentional leaks where panels cross each
other. Graphical rendering of coincident panels is unpredictable but
rarely good.

Several configuration files were written to test the surface actions
with all dimensions and all panel shapes. They are in the
examples/S7_surfaces directory and are called reflect\#.txt,
transmit\#.txt, and absorb\#.txt, where the ‘\#’ is 1, 2, or 3 for the
system dimensionality. Additionally, the three surf\#.txt files show the
basic actions in single files. Following is an excerpt from
reflect3.txt, which shows how a surface and its panels can be defined:

```
start_surface surf

panel disk 20 30 70 4 0 -1 0 20
panel disk 20 50 70 4 0 1 0 20
end_surface
```

Several statements control the drawing of surfaces to the graphics
window. The color statement specifies the color of the front and/or back
of the surface with either color words or red, green, blue, and alpha
(opacity) values. As mentioned above in the graphics section, OpenGL
does not render well with alpha values between 0 and 1. Thickness
defines the line width that should be used for drawing surface edges, or
for surfaces in 2-dimensional systems. The polygon statement is used to
set the drawing mode for showing just the panel edges, only panel
vertices, or complete panel faces. It also allows filling of regions for
surfaces in 2-dimensions.

### Jumping surfaces

There are a few situations in which one might reasonably want to have
molecules move discontinuously, leaping from one place to another. One
is for periodic boundaries in which molecules that diffuse off of one
side of the system immediately diffuse onto the other side, thus keeping
the composition of the system constant while avoiding effects that can
arise from edges. Another situation is for building complex surface
structures from the Smoldyn panel primitives without resorting to
triangulated meshes. For example, one might want to have two spherical
cells whose cytoplasms are linked by a narrow cylindrical channel,
making a dumbbell shape. This would be easy to design in Smoldyn, except
that there is no way to cut holes in the spheres where the cylinder
should be attached. The solution is to put small disk-shaped `jumping`
panels on each side of the spot where the hole is wanted so that
molecules can be transported across the barrier (see
examples/S7_surfaces/dumbbell.txt).

To define a jumping surface, the action for each molecule that is to be
jumped (usually set to all molecules, although fewer is permissible
too), for the active face of the surface, is set to `jump.` Next, the
active face of each panel needs to be assigned a destination panel and
face using the jump statement. The source and destination panels are
required to be the same shape and to be parallel to each other although,
for certain shapes, they may differ in size.

Jumping surfaces are demonstrated with the files jump1.txt, jump2.txt,
and jump3.txt, all in the S7_surfaces directory.

Surface-bound molecules used to jump when they diffused onto panels that
had surface-bound jump actions. However, this feature was removed in
version 2.37 because it was complicated and there were better ways of
accomplishing the same result.

### Membrane-bound molecules

In Smoldyn, molecules can be in free solution or bound to surfaces. The
bound ones can be attached on the front of the surface or on the back,
called the `front` and `back` states, or they can be transmembrane
molecules in either an `up` orientation or a `down` orientation. The
precise meanings of these states are decided by the user. As an example,
if a receptor is oriented such that the ligand binding site is on the
outside of the cell, as usual, it could be called `up,` whereas if it
were in the membrane in a reversed orientation, it could be called
`down.` In all, there are five states that molecules can be in:
`solution,` `front,` `back,` `up,` or `down,` of which the last four
are the surface-bound states. In practice, all four surface-bound states
are essentially equivalent. A molecule in any of these states is allowed
to interact with solution-phase molecules that are on either side of the
surface, and it can desorb to either side of the surface. The only real
difference between these states is that Smoldyn ensures that molecules
in the `front` state have coordinates that are slightly on the front
side of the surface and those in the `back` state have coordinates that
are slightly on the back side of the surface. Smoldyn does not fix the
coordinates to be on any particular side for molecules in the `up` or
`down` states, which makes these states simulate very slightly faster.

Additionally, it is sometimes necessary to specify the position of a
solution-state molecule relative to a surface. For this, the
pseudo-states `fsoln` (which is identical to `solution`) and `bsoln`
specify that it is solution state and on the front or back of the
relevant surface.

The surface_mol statement, which was mentioned in the section on
molecules, is used to specify that there are molecules bound to a
surface at the start of a simulation. The statement is quite versatile,
allowing one to specify that molecules are scattered randomly over an
entire surface, over specific panel shapes, over specific panels, or
even over all surfaces. Also, of course, it is possible to specify exact
molecule locations.

The rate statement, mentioned before in the context of partially
permeable surfaces, is also used for transition rates for surface-bound
molecules. It can be used for specifying the rate at which a
solution-state molecular species is adsorbed onto a surface. It can also
be used for the release rate, from surface to solution. In this
situation, the release side of the surface is identified by giving the
destination state as either `fsoln` or `bsoln`, for the front and back,
respectively. Rate is also used for transition rates between the
different surface-bound states, such as from `front` to `back.`

Surface-bound molecules diffuse within the plane of the surface
according to the diffusion coefficient that was entered with the difc
statement for the respective molecule state. To allow molecules to
diffuse between neighboring surface panels, whether they are part of the
same surface or different surfaces, these neighbors have to be declared
with the neighbors statement. Diffusion on surfaces is reasonably
quantitatively accurate, which is best understood with an explanation of
the algorithm (most of which was new in version 2.37). Considering a
three-dimensional system, a surface-bound molecule is initially diffused
in all three dimensions. It is then moved back to the local plane of the
panel that it is bound to. If this puts the molecule within the area of
its panel, then the diffusion step is done and no further actions are
taken. This approach is exact for flat panels and reasonably good for
curved panels (and becomes exact in the limit of short time steps). If
the new position is not within the area of the molecule’s panel, Smoldyn
determines where the line of the molecule’s trajectory exits the current
panel. Smoldyn then determines if there are other panels at this point
(it actually checks for panels within an extremely small distance called
*neighdist* from this position, which is just large enough to prevent
problems from computer round-off error). If so, it chooses one of these
panels at random and rotates the molecule’s trajectory that extends
beyond the original panel into the plane of the new panel, thus
preserving the length of the trajectory. If the end point of the new
trajectory is within the new panel, then the diffusion step is done. If
not, Smoldyn repeats the procedure until the trajectory is used up.
Returning to a prior condition, if the molecule’s trajectory leaves the
molecule’s current panel but there is no neighbor near the exiting
point, then the molecule does not continue onto a neighbor. Instead, it
reflects off of the panel edge, so that the trajectory continues on the
original panel. This procedure should be exact for flat panels and
extremely good for curved panels.

Note that molecules only transition from one panel to another when they
diffuse off the edge of the initial panel. Thus, for example, a molecule
can never diffuse off an edge of a sphere, with the result that
molecules cannot diffuse from one sphere to another, even if these
spheres intersect. If diffusion between panels is desired in these
cases, then use the neighbor_action statement, as described above.
However, be forewarned that diffusion between neighboring panels can
interact badly with the neighbor_action hopping, which is why this
hopping is turned off as a default. For example, suppose several 2D
panels (which are lines) meet at a single point. A molecule diffusing
along one of the panels correctly transitions to a new randomly chosen
panel when it gets to that point. However, if neighbor_action is set to
hopping, then the trajectory during this transition might be discovered
to cross yet another one of the panels in the process, so the molecule
would then get moved onto this new panel. The probability of this
outcome is biased by the precise panel positions and by round-off
errors, with the result that the molecule position statistics would be
incorrect.

Files that demonstrate surface-bound molecules are: `S7_surfaces/stick2.txt`
and `cellmesh.txt` (which reads `cellmeshfile.txt`).  Surface diffusion is
demonstrated with the files in `S7_surfaces/surfacediffuse/`.

### Smoldyn bugs

As far as I know, there are no bugs currently in Smoldyn that cause
surfaces to behave other than requested. However, leaking surfaces have
been a recurring problem with Smoldyn. In this problem, which can be
caused by any of a vast number of small mistakes in the source code,
molecules that shouldn’t go through a surface are found to have done so.
Some commands that were written to test for it are: warnescapee and
killmoloutsidesystem. If you suspect that Smoldyn isn’t working right,
or if you just want to verify that it is working right (a good idea if
you don’t use graphical output), then it might be worth running these or
other commands. The former one has to be run at every time step to be
useful. The latter one has no output directly, but will identify
problems if it is bracketed by molcount commands. The command
killmolinsphere can be used in a similar manner.

### Rates of surface interactions

For an interaction to occur between a solution-state molecule and a
surface, the molecule has to (1) contact the surface and (2) interact
based on some probability. There are subtleties both in the
determination of contacts and in the calculation of these probabilities.

Starting with the contacts, a molecule clearly contacted a surface
during the preceding time step if it ended up across the surface from
where it began, which I’ll call a direct collision. It is also possible
for a molecule to start and end on the same side of a surface, but to
have contacted the surface at some point during the time step, labeled
here as an indirect collision. The probability of an indirect collision
occurring is (Andrews and Bray, *Phys. Biol.* 2004)

$$ \exp\left(-\frac{l_1l_2}{DΔt}\right) $$

Here, *l*<sub>1</sub> and *l*<sub>2</sub> are the perpendicular
distances to the surface before and after the time step, *D* is the
diffusion coefficient, and ∆*t* is the time step. These indirect
collisions are implemented in Smoldyn for simulating absorption of
molecules to the bounding walls of the system (the boundaries).

However, for interactions between diffusing molecules and all surfaces,
Smoldyn only accounts for direct collisions, thus ignoring the indirect
collisions. This decreases the accuracy of Smoldyn slightly but is done
because indirect collisions were found to be difficult to code,
computationally demanding, and made essentially no difference to
results.

The probability of interaction given that a collision has occurred is
difficult to calculate. While it is presented in a recent paper by Erban
and Chapman (*Phys. Biol.* 4:16-28, 2007) for adsorption interactions,
their equation turns out to only be accurate in the limit of short time
steps. Thus, I found the necessary relationships between the adsorption,
desorption, or transmission coefficients and the corresponding
adsorption, desorption, and transmission probabilities. They are
implemented in the SurfaceParam.c source code file of Smoldyn and have
been thoroughly tested. I plan to write these algorithms up and submit
them for publication during the next few months.

The adsorption coefficient, *κ*, has units of length/time. The product
*κc*, where *c* is a concentration (units of length<sup>–3</sup>), is
the adsorption rate in molecules adsorbed per unit of time, per unit of
surface area. If the surface is in equilibrium with the solution, where
there is a sticking coefficient of *κ*, and an unsticking rate of *k*,
then the equilibrium surface density of molecules is

$$ C_{surface} = \frac{κ}{k}C_{solution}$$

Surface sticking rates were tested with the example file stickrate.txt.
Here, a collection of molecules diffuses freely in solution, but sticks
with rate 0.5 on one side. This situation can be solved analytically as
well from equations in Crank, allowing for a good comparison. Comparison
between simulation and theory are shown in the figure below.

![](../media/image21.png){: style="width:300px"}  
![](../media/image22.png){: style="width:300px"}

Results from example `stickrate.txt`, shown in red, are compared with the
analytic solution for the sticking rate. The left panel shows the total
number of molecules stuck to the surface. The right panel shows the
average sticking rate with a 5 time unit averaging window, with
comparisons to the expectation sticking rate shown with a solid line and
the 1 standard deviation range shown with dashed lines.

### Simulating effective unbounded diffusion

The example files in S7_surfaces/unbounded_diffusion illustrate and
verify the use of a partially absorbing bounding surface to simulate
effective unbounded diffusion. These files use the Smoldyn file
sphere.txt, which describes a sphere; I created it by using Mathematica
to define a sphere, triangulate it, and save it as a `wrl` (Virtual
Reality Modeling Language) file. Then, I used the wrl2smol utility
program to convert it to the Smoldyn-readable file sphere.txt. Other
Smoldyn configuration files specify either one or multiple emitters
within this sphere and then save concentration line profiles as
functions of time. The theoretical concentration distributions for these
situations is expressed with a slight extension of eq. 3.5b from Crank,
which leads to

$$C(r) = \sum_i \frac{q_i}{4π D|r-r_i|}\erfc{\frac{|r-r_i|}{2√{Dt}}}$$

Here, *C*(**r**) is the concentration at position **r**, *q<sub>i</sub>*
is the emission rate of source *i*, *D* is the diffusion coefficient,
**r***<sub>i</sub>* is the location of source *i*, and *t* is the time
since the sources started emitting. At steady-state, this concentration
equation simplifies to

$$C(r) = \sum_i\frac{q_i}{4π D$r-r_i|}$$

The figure below shows results from the emitter1.txt Smoldyn simulation,
in which an emitter at location **r**<sub>1</sub> = (-4.5,0,0) micron
emits *q*<sub>1</sub> = 500 molecules per second, these molecules have a
diffusion coefficient of *D* = 3 μm<sup>2</sup>/s, and the system is
surrounded by a triangulated sphere that is centered at the origin and
has radius 10 microns. Absorption to this sphere was set to make the
molecules diffuse as though the system were unbounded. Close agreement
between simulation and theory show that the algorithm works well.

![](../media/image25.png){: style="width:300px"} 
![](../media/image26.png){: style="width:300px"}

The left panel shows a snapshot from example emitter1.txt where it is
seen that the emitter center is somewhat left of the sphere center and
the sphere is triangulated. The right panel shows line profiles across
the middle of the sphere, from (-10,0,0) to (10,0,0) at times *t* = 0.3
s (blue) and *t* = 100 s (red), with simulation data shown with points
and theoretical results, from the equations above, in solid lines.

## Reactions

### Reaction basics

There are three types of chemical reactions in Smoldyn: zeroth order,
first order, and second order, where the order is simply the number of
reactants. Synonyms for the latter two are unimolecular and bimolecular
reactions. In addition, Smoldyn simulates a couple of additional
interaction types using reactions; these are conformational spread
reactions and excluded volume reactions, both of which are described
below.

With zeroth order reactions, there are no reactants at all. Instead,
products appear spontaneously at random locations in the system volume
(or within a compartment) at a roughly constant rate. This is unphysical
because particles are being created from nothing. However, since Smoldyn
explicitly ignores many chemical species, the assumption here is that
some unmodeled chemicals are being converted into the zeroth order
product. Thus, it is assumed that there is a legitimate underlying
chemical reaction that produces the products that are seen, but it just
isn’t part of the model. (At least, this is the typical use of zeroth
order reactions; using them to model the magical production of matter is
fine too.)

First order reactions involve the conversion of one molecular species
into another. This includes spontaneous conformational changes of
proteins and chemical rearrangements of small molecules. Also, many
reactions are pseudo-first order, meaning that one of two reactants has
a sufficiently constant concentration and distribution that it can be
left out of the model and its effect is lumped into the rate constant of
a first order reaction. Protein phosphorylation by ATP is a good example
of this. In Smoldyn, reactants of first order reactions have a certain
probability of converting to products at each time step.

Second order reactions occur when two reactants collide and react
(conformational spread reactions are an exception, as described below).
In Smoldyn, a reaction radius is defined for each pair of molecular
species. For those that do not react with each other, the reaction
radius is 0. For those that can react, the reaction radius is some small
distance on the order of the molecular radii, with values that increase
monotonically with the standard mass action reaction rate. To simulate
each time step, molecules are first diffused and then, typically, all
reactant pairs that are closer than their reaction radii are reacted.
Thus, the stochasticity in simulated bimolecular reactions arises solely
from diffusion and not from the reaction step of the algorithm. It is
also possible for the reaction probability upon collision to be some
value less than one if desired, which can be useful for adjusting the
extent to which a reaction is diffusion- or activation-limited.

If a reaction has multiple products, they are usually all added to the
system at the same point. They can also be separated from each other by
a small amount, called the unbinding radius if there are two products,
which reduces the likelihood of their immediate recombination in a new
reaction. This recombination is called a geminate recombination.

It is possible to specify that a reaction should only occur within a
spatial compartment (defined below), or if one of the reactants is bound
to a specified surface. For example, it is possible to declare that a
zeroth order reaction should only produce product within a specific
compartment, or that a first order reaction is only active when the
reactant is within the specified compartment. In many cases, these rules
are unphysical, although they can be very useful for treating
interactions with spatially localized unmodeled chemical species. These
restrictions can slow down simulations, so only use them if they are
needed.

Conformational spread reactions are only intended to be used with
stationary reactants and are only permitted in reactions with two
reactants and two products. A conformational spread reaction is possible
if the reactants are closer together than the conformational spread
radius, which is analogous to the binding radius of normal second order
reactions (although its value is constant, regardless of the time step).
For a conformational spread reaction, the reaction rate has units of
inverse time, as it is for a first order reaction. If a reaction occurs,
the first entered reactant is replaced by the first product, and the
second reactant with the second product.

Excluded volume reactions use the reaction concept to simulate excluded
volume interactions. Here, the typical reaction is of the form A + B → A
+ B, with the `binding radius` set to the sum of the physical molecular
radii and the product placement type set to `bounce`. There are several
options for simulating these reactions. The default and usually best
approach is called the reflection method. Here, if molecules are found
to be within a binding radius after diffusion, their positions are
recomputed by reflecting the molecules off of each other based upon
their straight-line trajectories during the course of the time step; the
collision point is at the position along the trajectories where the
center-to-center distance equals the binding radius. A different
approach is the overlap method. Here, if molecules are found to be
closer than their binding radius after diffusion, then the distance by
which they are closer is added to the binding radius to compute the new
separation. The molecules are separated by this amount, while keeping
the molecule centers on the same line as they were on before they were
moved.

Each molecule has a serial number that can be used to uniquely identify
it. In most reactions, the reactants are simply removed from the system
and the reaction products are new molecules with new serial numbers.
However, this is not the case for conformational spread and excluded
volume reactions because the reactants and products are conceptually the
same molecules, so these products have the same serial numbers as the
reactants. It can also be helpful to maintain serial numbers in other
situations, such as for single molecule tracking. In these situations,
use the reaction_serialnum statement to define rules for the product
serial number assignments.

### Defining reactions

To define a reaction, enter the statement reaction, followed by the
reaction name, the reaction, and the rate constant. Here are some
examples:

```
reaction r1 A + B -> C 10
reaction bind receptor(up) + ligand(fsoln) -\> complex(up) 1
reaction ingest complex(up) -> receptor(up) + ligand(bsoln) 5
reaction tca 0 -> ATP 100
reaction decay fluorophore(all) -> 0 0.01
```

For molecule states that are not specified, as in the first example
above, it is assumed that the reaction only applies to molecules that
are in solution. Reactions that only occur in specified compartments are
entered in the same way, but with the reaction_cmpt statement. Versions
of Smoldyn prior to 1.82 allowed reactions to be entered in definition
blocks; this is still permitted for backward compatibility, but is
discouraged because this format is not being maintained and may be
eliminated in future versions.

For most applications, the reaction statement is sufficient for entering
the reaction rate. However, other methods are possible as well. It is
possible to leave the rate constant off of the reaction line and enter
it separately with the statement reaction_rate. The reaction rate is
the macroscopic reaction rate, which is converted into parameters that
Smoldyn can use for the simulation. For zeroth order reactions, the
reaction rate is converted to the average number of molecules that
should be added to the entire simulation volume at each time step. To
enter this internal value directly, use the statement
reaction_production. For first order reactions, the reaction rate is
converted to the probability that a reactant molecule will react during
one time step. This can be entered directly with the statement
reaction_probability. For second order reactions, the reaction rate is
converted into a reaction binding radius, which can be entered directly
with binding_radius.

If a reaction has multiple products, they are usually placed at the
location where the reaction was determined to have occurred. However,
offsets from the reaction location are possible as well, which are
necessary for reversible reactions so as to avoid certain geminate
recombinations. Offsets can be entered directly or can be calculated by
Smoldyn in many different ways. All of them are entered with the
product_placement statement.

Conformational spread reactions are a special type of bimolecular
reactions. For these, there is a domain of interaction, which is entered
with the statement confspread_radius; this also specifies that the
reaction uses conformational spread. Reaction rate constants for
conformational spread reactions have units of inverse time, like a first
order reaction rate constant. They indicate the rate at which a reaction
occurs, for reactants that are continuously closer to each other than
the conformational spread radius. As with first order reactions, this
rate value is converted to a reaction probability at each time step, and
can be entered directly with the reaction_probability statement. The
two products of conformational spread reactions are placed at the exact
same locations as the two reactants, using the same ordering of
reactants and products as they are listed with the reaction statement.

To simulate second order reactions with reaction probabilities that are
not equal to one (called the lambda-rho algorithm), you can set the
reaction probability with the reaction_probability statement.
Alternatively, you can set the reaction *χ* value, which is the ratio of
the actual reaction rate constant to the diffusion-limited reaction rate
constant, using reaction_chi.

### Statements about reactions

The following table summarizes the statements about reactions.

| statement |
|-----------|
| reaction *rname* *reactant<sub>1</sub>* + *reactant<sub>2</sub>* -> *product<sub>1</sub>* + *product<sub>2</sub>* *rate* |
| reaction *rname* *reactant<sub>1</sub>* + *reactant<sub>2</sub>* <-> *product<sub>1</sub>* + *product<sub>2</sub>* *rate<sub>fwd</sub> rate<sub>rev</sub>* |
| reaction compartment=*cname* *rname* *reactant<sub>1</sub>* + *reactant<sub>2</sub>* -\> *product<sub>1</sub>* + *product<sub>2</sub>* *rate* |
| reaction surface=*sname* *rname* *reactant<sub>1</sub>* + *reactant<sub>2</sub>* -\> *product<sub>1</sub>* + *product<sub>2</sub>* *rate* |
| reaction_rate *rname rate* |
| confspread_radius *rname rad* |
| binding_radius *rname rad* |
| reaction_probability *rname* *prob* |
| reaction_chi *rname* *chi* |
| reaction_production *rname* *value* |
| reaction_serialnum *rname* *rules_list* |
| product_placement *rname* *type parameters* |

### Reactions with a block format

Although now discouraged and deprecated, the block format for entering
reactions is similar. The block starts with the statement
`start_reaction` and ends with `end_reaction`, between which only
instructions that are relevant to reactions are allowed. The first
statement within a reaction block is order to define the reaction order
of this block. The max_rxn statement used to be required next, but is
no longer functional as of version 1.82. Basic reactions are entered
with a reactant statement, a rate statement, and a product statement. It
is also possible to enter the internal value that Smoldyn uses with
rate_internal. It is possible to turn states on or off with the permit
statement. If there are multiple products, and if these products can
react with each other (most often a reversible reaction), then Smoldyn
may need some information about the product unbinding radii, which is
entered with the product_param statement. It is discussed at length
below.

Conformational spread reactions are slightly different. Enter the
conformational spread radius with the confspread_radius statement and
the reaction rate (which is analogous to a first order rate) with rate.
This rate value is converted to a reaction probability at each time
step. To enter the latter value directly, do so with the probability
statement. The rate_internal statement is ignored.

### Zeroth order reactions

Zeroth order reactions have no reactants and yet produce products at a rate
that is constant except for stochastic fluctuations. They can be used to
simulate the production of molecules that are of interest from sub-systems that
are not of interest and thus are not explicitly part of the model. As mentioned
above, zeroth order reactions have not proven to be particularly useful.

The zeroth order reaction 0 → A proceeds according to the mass action rate
equation

$$\frac{d[A]}{dt} = k$$

$k$ is the reaction rate constant. Solving for the number of A molecules in
volume $V$ as a function of time yields the deterministic solution

$$ n(t)=n(0)+kt$$

$n(0)$ and $n(t)$ are the initial and time dependent numbers of $A$
molecules. There are also fluctuations due to the stochastic nature of
chemical processes. Smoldyn assumes that each molecule created in a
zeroth order reaction is created independently of each other, which
allows Poisson statistics to be used. As an example of a limitation,
this is not a perfect description of biochemical protein production
because that involves sequential stochastic DNA transcription followed
by many relatively rapid mRNA translations, thus leading to stochastic
bursts of protein production.

Zeroth order reactions were tested with the file zeroreact.txt. The
reaction portion of the configuration file is

```
reaction slow 0 -> red 0.001
reaction med 0 -> green 0.01
reaction fast 0 -> blue 0.1
```

As seen in the figure below, simulation results conform closely to
corresponding theoretical results, using a wide range of reaction rates.
As expected, stochastic deviations from the deterministic theoretical
predictions are seen.

![](../media/image29.png){: style="width:300px"}

This shows zeroth order reaction molecule production with data simulated
from the example file S8_reactions/zeroreact.txt. Shown are the numbers
of molecules produced as a function of time with three different
production rates along with the deterministic theory for how many
molecules would be expected.

### Unimolecular reactions

Order 1 reactions follow the general reaction equation A → B. The mass
action kinetics for the loss of reactant are described with the
differential equation

*k* is the first order reaction rate. This is solved to yield the
deterministic solution for the number of A molecules as a function of
time,

*n*(0) is the number of A molecules at time 0 and *n*(*t*) is the number
at time *t*.

The example file `S8_reactions/unireact1.txt` was used to check unimolecular
reaction rates using a wide range of reaction rates. The reaction portion of
the configuration file is

```
reaction slow red -> 0 0.1
reaction med green -> 0 1
reaction fast blue -> 0 10
```

As seen in the figure below there is good agreement between simulation
and theory. As always, stochastic fluctuations are apparent, which is
particularly true when there are few molecules.

First order reactions in which a reactant can react through multiple
possible pathways requires slightly more complicated calculations for
the reaction probabilities. However, the mass action differential
equation, shown above, is unchanged. This situation was tested with the
configuration file unireactn.txt. The reaction portion of the
configuration file is

```
reaction r1 A -> A + B 0.1
reaction r2 A -> A + C 0.05
reaction r3 A -> A + D 0.01
```

The system is started with only A molecules, so the theoretical number
of A molecules as a function of time is

$$n_A(t)=n_A(0)e^{-(k_B+k_C+k_D)t}$$

The number of B molecules as a function of time is

$$n_B(t)=n_A(0)\frac{k_B}{k_B+k_C+k_D}\left[1-e^{-(k_B+k_C+k_D)t}\right]$$

Analogous equations hold for C and D. Simulation results closely matched
these theoretical equations, as shown in the figure below.

![](../media/image34.png){: style="width:300px"} 
![](../media/image35.png){: style="width:300px"}

The panel on the left shows results from the configuration file
unireact1.txt. First order reactions occur at rates that are in good
agreement with theory over a wide range of rate values. The panel on the
right shows results from the file unireactn.txt. Again, there is good
agreement with theory.

### Bimolecular reactions

Bimolecular reactions have the generic reaction equation A + B → C, for
which the mass action kinetics are described by the deterministic
differential equations

$$\frac{d[A]}{dt}=\frac{d[B]}{dt}=-\frac{d[C]}{dt}=-k[A][B]$$

The reaction rate constant, *k*, is only actually constant if: (*i*) the
reaction kinetics are purely activation-limited, or (*ii*) the reaction
has proceeded long enough that a steady-state reactant distribution has
formed.

This equation is not quite as trivial to solve as prior ones were. With
the condition that there are the same numbers of A and B molecules
initially, the solution for the number of A molecules (or B molecules)
as a function of time is

$$n(t)=\left( \frac{1}{n(0)}+\frac{kt}{V}\right)^{-1}$$

As before, *n*(0) is the initial number of A or B molecules, *n*(*t*) is
the number of A or B molecules as a function of time, *k* is the
reaction rate constant and *V* is the volume of the system. This was
tested with three different reaction rates with the configuration file
reactAB.txt, for which the reaction portion of the file is

```
reaction slow As + Bs -> Cs 1
reaction med Am + Bm -> Cm 10
reaction fast Af + Bf -> Cf 100
```

The Smoldyn diagnostics output shows how these different reaction rates
are converted into simulation parameters. They are converted into
binding radii, which is small for the slow reaction and large for the
fast reaction. Because the reaction kinetics depend on the ratio of the
reactant rms steps lengths to the binding radii, the slow one has
relatively long steps compared to the binding radius and thus behaves as
though it is activation-limited. In contrast, the fast reaction has
short rms step lengths compared to the binding radius and so behaves as
though it is diffusion-limited. Shortening the simulation time step
would make all of these more diffusion-limited.

Activation-limited reactions follow the mass action kinetics shown in
the equations for all times. Thus, the slow and medium reaction rate
simulations agree well with the mass-action theory, as shown in the
figure, below. In contrast, the diffusion-limited simulation does not
agree with the mass-action theory. This is because the simulation starts
with molecules randomly distributed whereas the analytical result
assumes a steady-state distribution. However, after enough time has
passed for a steady state reactant distribution to be formed, it is
shown that the simulated results agree well with the analytical results
(orange line in the figure).

![](../media/image38.png){: style="width:300px"} 
![](../media/image39.png){: style="width:300px"}

The panel on the left shows reactant numbers for the reaction A + B → C
for three different reaction rates and with equal initial numbers of A
and B molecules. The panel on the right is similar but for the reaction
2A → C. Light black lines are solutions to the deterministic
steady-state mass action rate equations. Deviations arise for the faster
reactions (blue lines) because those start far from steady-state. Light
orange lines are the steady-state theory, starting with time 10 rather
than 0, so as to start at times when reactants are closer to
steady-state distributions.

### Reactions with identical reactants

Although there are no conceptual or simulation algorithm differences for
bimolecular reactions in which two reactants are the same, there are a
few quantitative differences. Consider a situation with 1000 A molecules
and 1000 B molecules. Despite the fact that each A molecule has about
1000 potential collision partners, whether the reactants are A + A or A
+ B, there are twice as many A-B collisions as A-A collisions. This is
because each A-A pair can be counted in either of two ways, but is still
only a single possible collision. To achieve the same reaction rate for
A + A reactants as for A + B, despite the fact that there are fewer
collisions, Smoldyn uses a larger binding radius for the former.

The analytical solution for the number of A molecules as a function of
time is also slightly different from before,

$$n(t)=\left( \frac{1}{n(0)}+\frac{2kt}{V}\right)^{-1}$$

The reaction description portion of the configuration file
S8_reactions/bireactAA.txt is

```
reaction slow As + As -> C 1
reaction med Am + Am -> C 10
reaction fast Af + Af -> C 50
```

Results are similar to those seen before. Simulation results agreed well
with the analytical equations if the reaction is activation-limited or
once the reactant distributions have reached steady-state, but agreement
is not good for diffusion-limited reactions away from steady-state. It
should be emphasized that these discrepancies are not errors by Smoldyn,
but are quite the opposite: they are approximations made in the
steady-state equations which people are used to making but which are
nevertheless incorrect, which are being compared to accurate simulations
by Smoldyn.

### Diffusion-limited reactions

Diffusion-limited reactions can be simulated well by Smoldyn. The
example file bireactABB.txt again simulates the reaction A + B → C, but
now with a lot more B molecules than A ones, and with a time step that
is sufficiently short that the reaction simulates as though it is
diffusion-limited. As is shown in the figure below, results conform
closely to the Smoluchowski prediction for this reaction.

This example shows diffusion-limited bimolecular reactions from the
configuration file bireactABB.txt, which simulates the reaction that is
described in Figure 7 of Andrews and Bray, 2004. The left panel shows
the number of surviving A molecules as a function of time with
comparison to the time-dependent Smoluchowski equation. The right panel
shows the reaction rate per A molecule per time unit as a function of
time along with the Smoluchowski prediction with the solid black line
and predicted fluctuations with the dashed lines.

### Reversible reactions

Reversible reactions, where at least one has multiple products, involve
geminate recombination issues, as discussed below. The accuracy of
reversible reaction rates using the default reverse parameter type and
parameter was investigated with the configuration file
S8_reactions/equil/equil.txt. Here, an equilibrium is set up for the
reaction A + B ↔ C.

From standard chemistry, the equilibrium constant is related to the
ratio of product to reactant concentrations and to the ratio of the
forward to reverse rate constants,

$$K = \frac{n_C V}{n_A n_B}=\frac{k_f}{k_r}$$

$V$ is the total system volume. The configuration file `equil.txt` starts with
equal numbers of A and B molecules and no C molecules. Using the above equation
and this starting point, the solution for the equilibrium number of A molecules
is

$$n_A = \frac{-V+ \sqrt{V^2+4Kn_A(0)V}}{2K}$$

$n_A(0)$ is the initial number of A molecules. It was verified
that the simulation result approached this value.

This figure shows the equilibrium result from example file
`S8_reactions/equil/equil.txt`.

### Multi-step reactions

Many biochemical models include reactions that do not fall neatly into
the 0<sup>th</sup>, 1<sup>st</sup>, or 2<sup>nd</sup> order reaction
categories, but are instead complex reactions that include multiple
elementary steps. Whereas these complex reactions can be well-defined
for models that are either deterministic or non-spatial, they simply
don’t make sense when individual molecules are modeled. Thus, to
include them in a Smoldyn model, one has to explicitly define each of
the steps.

Taking the Michaelis-Menten reaction as an example, consider substrate
S, enzyme E, and product P. The full reaction system is

$$ E+S\xrightleftharpoons[k_{-1}]{k_1} ES \xrightarrow{k_2} P$$

All three of these reactions, along with the enzyme-substrate complex
ES, need to be defined in a Smoldyn file. Of course, this means that you
also need to give the three reaction rate constants *k*<sub>1</sub>,
*k*<sub>-1</sub>, and *k*<sub>2</sub>. Assume you know the Michaelis
constant *K<sub>M</sub>* and the maximum reaction velocity
*V<sub>max</sub>*. As can be found in any biochemistry textbook, these
are connected to the underlying rate constants as

$$K_M=\frac{k_{-1}+k_2}{k_1}, \quad V_{max}=k_2[E]_0$$

where \[E\]<sub>0</sub> is the total enzyme concentration. These two
equations are not sufficient to solve for the three rate constants, so
let us define the unitless reaction efficiency ratio, *r*, as the
fraction of ES that goes to P,

$$r=\frac{k_2}{k_{-1}+k_2}$$

This value can range between 0 and 1, where small values represent rapid
equilibration between E, S, and ES, and high values represent rapid
reaction of ES to P. Typical Michaelis-Menten analyses assume the former
situation, so we might guess that *r* is 0.1. Solving these equations
for the reaction rate constant yield:

$$k_1=\frac{V_{max}}{[E]_0K_Mr}, \quad k_{-1}=\frac{V_{max}(1-r)}{[E]_0r}, \quad k_2=\frac{V_{max}}{[E]_0}$$

Other multi-step reactions can be broken down to elementary reactions in
a similar manner. The need to include additional assumptions, as we did
here with *r*, is typical when converting from a low-detail reaction
rate equation to a high-detail reaction mechanism.

### Reaction networks

The reaction types presented above can be combined to create essentially
unlimited varieties of reaction networks. A particularly simple one is
shown here as an example. It is the classic Lotka-Volterra reaction
network, which was originally designed to explain observed oscillations
in ecological predator-prey systems but is also analogous to many
natural biochemical oscillators. The terminology used here borrows from
the ecology application, although all numbers were chosen solely to make
for an interesting simulation result. The complete file
S8_reactions/lotvolt/lotvolt.txt is:

```

This involves several statements that make the simulation run
efficiently. Graphics are only displayed every 5 iterations, the
simulation is set up with only 1 molecule per virtual box, and the
rabbit and fox molecules are stored in separate molecule lists. Results
from this file are shown in the figure below.

![](../media/image54.png){: style="width:300px"}
![](../media/image55.png){: style="width:300px"}

These figures show results from Lotka-Volterra simulation. The first
panel shows of snapshot of the simulation after it has run for long
enough for the regular boom-and-bust pattern to develop. Red dots are
`rabbits` and green dots are `foxes`. The next panel shows the numbers
of `rabbit` and `fox` molecules as a function of time, with the same
colors, again illustrating the boom-and-bust pattern. The panel on the
right is a phase portrait of the data shown in the center; oscillations
lead to cycles in the phase portrait and the initial large spike is seen
as the large diameter cycle.

### Conformational spread reactions

Currently, Smoldyn only allows second order reactions that have exactly
two products to be declared a conformational spread reaction. Defining
them as a conformational spread reaction, which is done with the
confspread_radius statement, implies a few things. Typically, the
diffusion coefficients of both reactants are zero, although this is not
required. The reaction rate constant that is entered is a *first order*
rate constant, meaning that it has units of inverse time. It is
interpreted as the rate at which a reaction will occur, given that both
reactants are continuously closer to each other than the conformational
spread radius. Finally, the products of a conformational spread reaction
are placed in the exact same locations as the reactants, and in the
spots that correspond to the order in which the reactants and products
were listed in the configuration file. For example, consider the
conformational spread reaction defined with the statements

```
reaction rxn1 A + B -> C + D 10
confspread_radius rxn1 5
```

This states that a conformational spread reaction can occur between any
A and B molecules that are closer than 5 distance units apart. At each
time step, the probability of its occurring is found from the reaction
rate of 10 inverse time units according to the same formulae that were
described above for unimolecular reactions. If it occurs, the A molecule
will be replaced by a C molecule and the B molecule will be replaced
with a D molecule.

Conformational spread processes are frequently symmetric such that
activity can be spread from an active molecule to its neighbor, and also
inactivity can spread from an inactive molecule to its neighbor. This
can be entered in Smoldyn with a pair of conformational spread
reactions:

```
reaction rxna inactive + active -> active + active 10
reaction rxni active + inactive -> inactive + inactive 10
confspread_radius rxna 5
confspread_radius rxni 5
```

This will yield a warning in Smoldyn about there being multiple
bimolecular reactions listed with the same reactants, but it is the
right way to list these symmetric effects. In this example, the
convention was followed that the latter reactant (and latter product) is
the neighbor molecule, while the former reactant is the one that changes
state.

If a molecule has simultaneous conformational spread interactions with
more than one other molecule, the simulated reaction rates may be too
low; this effect is reduced to zero for short time steps and increases
with longer time steps. Consider a potential reaction with two reaction
channels and the probability it happening by either channel individually
is *p*. When the two channels are considered sequentially, the
probability for the first happening should be *p*, while the probability
for the second should *p*/(1–*p*), because it is the conditional
probability of the second reaction happening, given that the first one
did not happen. However, Smoldyn uses probability *p* for all
conformational spread reaction channels, which leads to a reaction rate
that is too low. While this identical effect is addressed correctly for
first order reactions and for state conversions of surface-bound
molecules, it is not addressed for conformational spread reactions
because it is nearly impossible for Smoldyn to figure out how many
reaction channels are available for any particular conformational spread
reaction.

Conformational spread reactions were tested with the configuration file
`confspread.txt`. It simulates two reactions:

```
reaction back green -> red 10
reaction fwd red + blue -> green + blue 10
confspread_radius fwd 5
```

While it is simplistic for most conformational spread situations, it
leads to a simple equilibrium between red and green molecules which
allows for easy analytical calculations of the correct outcome. If each
red/green molecule is within a conformational spread radius of one blue
molecule (accomplished by setting the conformational spread radius to
3), the forward and reverse rates are each 10 and an equal number of red
and green molecules should be observed. On the other hand, an increased
conformational spread radius (5, as shown above) implies that each
red/green molecule is within reach of two blue molecules, so the forward
rate doubles, as does the equilibrium constant. Both of these behaviors
were confirmed. As described above, conformational spread reaction
probabilities that were greater than about 0.05 for each reaction led to
conformational spread reaction rates that were observed to be slightly
too low for the case in which each red molecule was within the
conformational spread radius of two blue molecules.

![](media/image56.png){: style="width:300px"} 
![](media/image57.png){: style="width:300px"}

This figure show output from confspread.txt configuration file. There
are conformational spread reactions between blue molecules and red
molecules, which convert red to green; reversion is a simple reaction.
The panel on the right shows the average probability of molecules being
in their red states, for a situation in which rate constants are equal
for the forward and reverse reactions, but each red/green molecule is
within a conformational spread radius of two blue molecules, thus
doubling the red → green reaction rate.

### Excluded volume reactions

Smoldyn can treat molecules as though they have excluded volume using
the same reaction concept that was developed for bimolecular reactions.
The user specifies the collision radius (using the binding_radius
statement) for each pair of species that is supposed to respect each
others’ excluded volume and then makes this an excluded volume reaction
with the product_placement statement, with the bounce option. If
molecules of those two species end up within their collision radius at
the end of a time step, they are then moved apart. The reactants and
products may be the same molecular species, in which case the molecules
are simply pushed apart. They can also be different species. Molecules
maintain their serial numbers. There are several options for the
product_placement parameter value. Setting it to a positive value
(which should be larger than the binding radius) causes the two products
to be placed at this distance apart, along the same vector as the
molecules were on before they were moved apart. Setting it to -1 is
generally more accurate; here, the products are separated by the binding
radius plus the distance that the reactants had been inside of the
binding radius. This separation is along the vector that separated the
reactants. Setting it to -2, or leaving the value blank because this is
the default method, is better yet. Here, the molecules bounce
ballistically off of each other. This is the most accurate method. In
all cases, the reaction rate value is largely meaningless for excluded
volume reactions.

If molecules are not supposed to pass by each other, which can be
simulated using excluded volume reactions and a one-dimensional system,
then it is important to make the excluded volume binding radius
significantly larger than the rms step lengths of the molecules. Because
molecules move during diffusion with Gaussian-distributed displacements,
and Gaussians have long tails, it is likely to be very difficult to
ensure that absolutely no molecules cross that should not.

I illustrate excluded volume reactions with several examples, all of
which are in the S8_reactions/bounce directory. In one, bounce.txt,
molecules are confined to a line and maintain their ordering. The
configuration file statements that declare the excluded volume reactions
are:

```
reaction rxn1 red(up) + green(up) -> red(up) + green(up)
binding_radius rxn1 1
product_placement rxn1 bounce -2
```

A second example involves a crowded system and is in the same directory
and the file crowding.txt.

![](../media/image58.png){: style="width:300px"} 
![](../media/image59.png){: style="width:300px"}

These figures show output from bounce.txt and crowding.txt. In the
former, red and green molecules, both of which are confined to the
diagonal line, bounce off of each other. This has the result that the
ordering of red and green molecules does not change during the
simulation. The latter file shows that this crowding method works even
with relatively high molecule densities. These molecules clearly do not
overlap each other. During the simulation, molecules diffuse within the
confines set by their neighbors.

### Binding and unbinding radii

For every bimolecular reaction, Smoldyn has to calculate the correct
binding radius from the reaction rate that is given in the configuration
file. Also, for every reaction that leads to multiple products, Smoldyn
has to determine the correct unbinding radius, using whatever product
parameter is supplied, if any. Product parameters are listed in the
table, below. While these binding and unbinding radii are well defined
microscopic parameters (at least within the context of the Smoluchowski
model system that is simulated), the meanings of the experimental rate
constants, including those given in the configuration file, are not
nearly as well defined. Instead, those rate constants depend on the
conditions under which they were measured. Smoldyn accounts for this by
attempting to guess the experimental conditions, using a process
described here. If Smoldyn’s guess is correct, the simulated reaction
rates should exactly match the experimental rates (not including edge
effects, which are typically negligible unless one reactant is fixed at
or near an edge).

The following table shows product parameters for reactions with multiple
products.

__Special product types__

|   |    |    |
| --|----|----|
| `i` | `irrev` | reaction is declared irreversible (*σ~u~*=0) |
| `a` | `confspread` | conformational spread reaction (entered automatically for you) |

__Use these if reversible reactions were measured at equilibrium__

|     |      |        |
|-----|------|--------|
| `p` | `pgem` | probability of geminate reaction (*φ*). |
| `x` | `pgemmax` | maximum probability of geminate reaction (*φ~max~*) |
| `r` | `ratio` | unbinding radius relative to binding radius (*σ~u~*/*σ~b~*) |
| `b` | `unbindrad` | fixed length unbinding radius (*σ~u~*) |

__Use these if reversible reactions were measured with all product removed as
it was formed__

|     |    |     |
|-----|----|-----|
| `q` | `pgem2` | probability of geminate reaction (*φ*) |
| `y` | `pgemmax2` | maximum probability of geminate reaction (*φ~max~*) |
| `s` | `ratio2` | unbinding radius relative to binding radius (*σ~u~*/*σ~b~*) |
| `o` | `offset` | fixed offset of products, rotationally randomized (*σ~u~*) |
| `f` | `fixed` | fixed offset of products, not rotationally randomized (*σ~u~*) |

Either the single-letter code or the full word may be used to define the
product parameter type, although the latter is suggested for readability. The
default type is pgemmax with a value of 0.2.

In all cases, Smoldyn assumes that rate constants were measured using an
effectively infinite number of reactant molecules, in an infinite
volume, that were started well mixed and that then were allowed to react
until either an equilibrium was reached for reversible reactions, or a
steady-state reaction rate was reached for irreversible reactions. Only
in these cases is mass action kinetics correct and is the reaction rate
constant actually constant. The precise experimental assumptions are
clarified with the following examples.

!!! example  "A + B → C"

    The rate constant is assumed to have been measured at steady state,
    starting with a well-mixed system of A and B. No product parameter is
    required. At steady-state, the simulation matches mass action
    kinetics.

!!! example "X → A + B"

    There is no bimolecular reaction, so no binding radius is calculated.
    The default unbinding radius is 0, although it is possible to define a
    different one. If the product parameter type is pgem, pgem2, ratio, or
    ratio2, an error is returned due to the lack of a binding radius. If
    the parameter type is not given or is irrev, pgemmax, or pgemmax2, the
    unbinding radius is set to 0. If it is unbindrad, fixed, or offset,
    the requested separation is used. At steady-state, the simulation
    matches mass action kinetics.

!!! example "A + B ↔ C"

      If the reversible parameter is pgem, pgemmax, unbindrad, or ratio, the
      forward rate constant is assumed to have been measured using just this
      system of reactions after the system had reached equilibrium. The product
      parameter is used to yield the correct probability of geminate
      recombination if possible, or the desired unbinding radius. In this case,
      the simulation matches mass action kinetics at equilibrium. If the
      product parameter is pgem2, pgemmax2, ratio2, offset, fixed, or irrev,
      then it is assumed that the forward rate constant was measured at
      steady-state and with all C removed as it was formed, thus preventing any
      geminate reactions. The unbinding radius is set as requested, using the
      binding radius if needed. In this case, the simulated forward reaction
      rate is higher than requested due to geminate rebindings.

!!! example "A + B ↔ C → Y"

    The second reaction is ignored for determining parameters for A + B.
    Instead, the first reaction is considered as though the rates were
    determined experimentally using just the system given in example 3. If the
    product parameter is pgem, pgemmax, ratio, or unbindrad, the simulated
    reaction rate for the forward reaction A + B → C will be lower than the
    requested rate because there are fewer geminate reactions than there would
    be with the equilibrium system.  Alternatively, it will be higher than the
    requested rate if the product parameter is pgem2, pgemmax2, ratio2, offset,
    fixed, or irrev, because there are some geminate reactions.

!!! example "X → A + B → C"

    The binding radius for the second reaction is treated as in example 1,
    without consideration of the first reaction. The unbinding radius for
    the first reaction is found using the binding radius of the second
    reaction. Here, product parameters pgem and pgem2 are equivalent,
    pgemmax and pgemmax2 are equivalent, and ratio and ratio2 are
    equivalent. The actual reaction rate for the second reaction, found
    with a simulation, will be higher than the requested value due to
    geminate rebindings that occur after the dissociation of X molecules.

!!! example "X → A + B ↔ C"

    The A + B ↔ C binding and unbinding radii are treated as in example 3.
    Another unbinding radius is required for the first reaction, which is
    found as in example 5, using the binding radius from the second
    reaction. Mass action kinetics are not followed.

!!!  example "X ↔ A + B ↔ C"

    The binding radii and unbinding radii for each bimolecular reaction
    are found as in example 3, independent of the other bimolecular
    reaction. The simulated rates may be different from those requested
    because of differing unbinding radii.

!!! example "X → A + B → C, A + B → D"

    The binding radii for the two bimolecular reactions are each found as
    in example 1. The unbinding radius for the first reaction cannot be
    determined uniquely, because the two forward reactions from A + B are
    equivalent and are likely to have different binding radii. Smoldyn
    picks the binding radius for the first forward reaction that is
    listed. Thus, if the product parameter for dissociation of X is pgem,
    the requested geminate rebinding probability will be found for the
    reaction A + B → C, but a different value will be found for the
    reaction A + B → D.

!!! example "C ↔ A + B ↔ C"

    This reaction scheme might represent two different pathways by which A
    and B can bind to form an identical complex. However, Smoldyn cannot
    tell which reverse reaction corresponds to which forwards reaction.
    Instead, for both determining the binding and unbinding radii, it uses
    the first reverse reaction that is listed.

The general principle for calculating binding radii is that Smoldyn first looks
to see if a reaction is directly reversible (*i.e.* as in example 3, without
any consideration of reaction network loops or other possible causes of
`geminate` reactions). If it is and if the reversible parameter is `pgem`,
`pgemmax`, `ratio`, or `unbindrad`, then the binding radius is found under the
assumption that the rate constant was measured using just this reaction, at
equilibrium. If not, or if the reversible parameter is `pgem2`, `pgemmax2`,
`ratio2`, `offset`, `fixed`, or `irrev`, then Smoldyn calculates the binding
radius with the assumption that the rate constant was measured using just that
reaction at steady-state and with all product removed as it is formed.

Unbinding radii typically require a reversible parameter (except as in
example 2). If the parameter is `unbindrad`, `offset`, or `fixed`, the
requested unbinding radius is used. If it is `irrev`, the unbinding radius
is set to 0. Otherwise, it can only be calculated with the knowledge of
the binding radius. If the reaction is directly reversible, the binding
radius for the reverse reaction is used. If it is not directly
reversible but the products can react, as in examples 5, 6, and 8, then
the binding radius for the first reaction that is listed is used.

### Bimolecular reactions and surfaces

Does a bimolecular reaction occur if there is a surface between the
reactants? This turns out to be a somewhat complex question. The simple
answer is that it does occur if the surface is transparent to both
molecular species and it does not occur if the surface is reflective or
absorptive to both molecular species. In principle, reactions should be
possible across pairs of jump surfaces, although they are not performed
by the current Smoldyn version which treats jump surfaces as though they
are opaque with respect to reactions.

Smoldyn determines where the reaction location is using a weighed
average of the reactant diffusion coefficients. The reaction takes place
only if both reactants can get to the reaction position, considering any
intervening surfaces. Absorption on the opposite side of a surface is
not worried about, the logic being that molecules are already in contact
when a reactant traverses the surface, and so opposite-side absorption
is no more important than the reaction. For partially transparent
surfaces, reactions occur depending on the probability of transparency.

When molecules have excluded volume, which they do not in Smoldyn, even
inert impermeable surfaces can affect the local concentrations of
chemicals. An obvious effect is that a molecule cannot be closer to a
surface than its radius, leading to a concentration of zero closer than
that. In a mixture of large and small molecules, Brownian motion tends
to push the large molecules up against surfaces while the small
molecules occupy the center of the accessible volume, thus creating more
complex concentration effects. These effects do not occur when excluded
volume is ignored, as it is in Smoldyn, in which case surfaces do not
affect local concentrations.

While surfaces do not affect concentrations of non-reacting molecules,
they do affect reaction rates. Consider the reaction A + B → C, where A
is fixed and B diffuses. If essentially all A molecules are far from a
surface, the diffusion limited reaction rate is found by solving the
diffusion equation for the radial diffusion function (RDF) with the
boundary conditions that the RDF approaches 1 for large distances and is
0 at the binding radius (see the paper by myself and Dennis Bray titled
`Stochastic simulation of chemical reactions with spatial resolution
and single molecule detail`). This leads to the Smoluchowski rate
equation

$$ k = 4π D σ_b$$

However, for an A molecule that is near a surface, an additional
boundary condition is that the gradient of the 3 dimensional RDF in a
direction perpendicular to the surface is zero at the surface. This
makes the solution of the reaction rate sufficiently difficult that I
have not attempted to solve it, but the result is different from the
simple result given above. This surface effect is an issue whenever the
A molecule is within several binding radii of a surface and is
especially pronounced when it is closer to the surface than its binding
radius. For cases in which the A molecule is more than one binding
radius from the surface, B molecules are going to take longer than usual
to reach the region between the A and the surface, leading to a
decreased reaction rate. It is suspected that the reaction rate
decreases monotonically as the A molecule approaches and then crosses a
surface.

A special case that can be solved exactly occurs when the A molecule is
exactly at the surface, such that half of the binding volume is
accessible to B molecules and half is inaccessible. Now, the RDF inside
the system volume is identical to the RDF for the case when the A
molecule is far from a surface. The logic is to assume that this is true
and to then observe that it already satisfies the additional boundary
condition. Using this RDF, the diffusive flux is half of the diffusive
flux for an A molecule far from a surface, because only half of the
binding surface is exposed to the system. Thus, the diffusion limited
reaction rate for the situation in which a reactant is fixed exactly at
a surface is

$$k=2π Dσ_b$$

The situation changes some when simulation time steps are sufficiently
long that rms step lengths are much longer than binding radii. Now, the
probability of a reaction occurring during a time step is a function of
only the binding volume. Thus, there are no surface effects at all when
an A molecule is fixed anywhere in the simulation volume that is greater
than or equal to one binding radius away from a surface. As the A
molecule is moved closer to the surface, the reaction rate decreases in
direct proportion to the binding volume that is made inaccessible to B
molecules. An especially easy situation is that when the A molecule is
exactly at the surface, the reaction rate is half of its value when the
A molecule is far from a surface, which is the same as the diffusion
limited result.

These results can be turned around to solve for the binding radius. If
the reaction is diffusion limited, the binding radius should double when
a reactant is placed exactly at the surface to maintain the same
reaction rate. If it is activation limited, the binding radius should
increase by 2<sup>1/3</sup> to maintain the same reaction rate. As usual
though, the binding radius is more closely related to the fundamental
physical properties of the molecule than is the rate constant, so it is
essential to consider the experimental conditions that were used for
measuring the rate constant.

In conclusion, reaction rates are reduced near surfaces and the effect
is different for diffusion limited and activation limited reactions.
However, for both cases, and almost certainly for all cases in between,
the reaction rate is exactly half when an A molecule is fixed at a
surface, compared to when it is far from a surface. A few tests with
Smoldyn using the files wallreact.txt, suggested that these surface
effects are likely to be minimal for most situations, although it is
good to be aware of their potential. The exception is that there are
large surface effects when molecules are fixed with a significant
portion of the binding volume outside the simulation volume.

## Compartments

### Compartment basics

Compartments are regions of volume that are bounded by surfaces. In
general, they do not include their bounding surfaces. Compartments are
useful for input or output and, as mentioned above, zeroth and first
order reactions can be made to be only active within specified
compartments. Compartments can also be moved around using various
commands, thus providing support for moving surfaces. In addition,
compartments are used for communication with the MOOSE simulator.

The inside of a compartment is defined to be all points from which one
can draw a straight line to one of the `inside-defining points` without
crossing any bounding surface. For example, to create a spherical
compartment, one would define a spherical surface as the boundary and
some point inside the sphere (the center, or any other internal point)
to be the inside-defining point. This definition allows a wide variety
of options. For example, it allows disjoint compartments and
compartments that are not inside closed surfaces. To set a sharp edge to
a compartment, but one which does not affect molecule diffusion, just
add a surface that is transparent to all molecules but which serves as
one of the compartment’s bounding surfaces.

In addition, compartments can be composed from previously defined
compartments using logic arguments. This way, for example, a cell
cytoplasm compartment can be defined as the region that is within a cell
compartment but that is not also within a nucleus compartment. Or, the
region that is outside of a cell can be simply defined as the region
that is not inside the cell.

### Defining compartments

The definition style for compartments is much like it is for other
portions of the code. Compartment statements for specific compartments
are entered in blocks that start with start_compartment and end with
end_compartment. The compartment name, which is given after
start_compartment, is used to start a new compartment definition, or to
continue defining a previously started one. Bounding surfaces and
interior-defining points are added with the surface and point
statements, respectively. The compartment command, used within a
compartment block, is used to define one compartment in terms of others.
Using this command one can, for example, define a compartment as the
union or the intersection of two previously defined compartments.

To state that molecules start in a compartment, use the compartment_mol
statement that was listed in the molecules section. To read the numbers
of molecules in a compartment, use the command molcountincmpt or
molcountincmpt2.

Following are excerpts from configuration files that use compartments:

__Compartment defined with surfaces and points__

```
start_compartment middle
surface surf
point 50 75
point 50 25
point 75 50
point 25 50
end_compartment
compartment_mol 500 red middle
```

__Compartments defined with other compartments__

```
start_compartment intersection

end_compartment

start_compartment either

end_compartment

start_compartment outside
compartment equalnot left
compartment andnot right
end_compartment

compartment_mol 500 red intersection
compartment_mol 500 green either
compartment_mol 500 blue outside
```

These files are in the examples folder in `S9_compartments`. The first is
called `compart.txt` and the second is `compartlogic.txt`. They yield the
following results:

![](media/image62.png){: style="width:300px"} 
![](media/image63.png){: style="width:300px"}

This figure shows examples of compartments. In the left panel, green
dots are the interior-defining points and red molecules were added
randomly to the compartment. In the right panel, each circle was defined
as a compartment and then the red, green, and blue molecule regions were
defined with logical combinations of the left and right compartments.

For logically combining compartments, the logical options are: `equal`,
`equalnot`, `and`, `andnot`, `or`, `ornot`, or `xor`. These obey the
standard logical rules. Note that the sequence of statements matters.
For example, the region defined by A-andnot-B is the portion of A is
that is not within B, whereas B-andnot-A is the portion of B that is not
within A.

### Compartments and efficiency

To test whether a given point is within a given compartment, Smoldyn
starts by computing a line between that point and one of the
interior-defining points. Smoldyn then tests whether this line crossed
any of the panels of any of the compartment’s bounding surfaces. If so,
Smoldyn moves on to the next interior-defining point and repeats. The
procedure stops as soon as a line can be drawn without crossing any
surface panel, if that happens. This procedure is rapid for compartments
with one panel and one interior-defining point, but can become extremely
slow for surfaces with many panels and/or many interior-defining points.
As a result, it is helpful to design compartments for efficient
simulation. Also, it’s best to avoid compartments if they aren’t needed.
For example, don’t use the reaction_compartment statement if you don’t
actually need the compartment testing.

## Simulation Settings

### Simulation settings basics

Several statements define how the simulation should be run. There are
defaults for each of these settings, so the user does not need to set
them directly. However, they can be useful for optimizing simulation
performance. These settings include the random number generator seed,
virtual boxes that partition the simulation volume, and some settings
for diffusion on surfaces.

The simulation volume is partitioned into an array of virtual boxes,
each of which is the same size and shape. In addition, each box that is
on the edge of the simulation volume actually extends out to infinity in
that direction, such that every location in space, whether in the
simulation volume or not, is in some virtual box. These boxes do not
affect the performance of the simulation, except for allowing
computational efficiencies that speed it up.

### Random number seed

As a default, the random number generator seed is set to the time at
which the simulation is started. This is virtually certain to yield a
unique random number sequence each time the simulation is run, so no two
simulations will be identical. However, it can also be useful to set the
random number generator seed, which can be done with the random_seed
statement. This statement can also be used to set the random number seed
to the current time.

Smoldyn uses the Mersenne Twister random number generator, which has
become a standard generator for many applications because it is fast and
very high quality. Because Smoldyn uses this method rather than built-in
generators, Smoldyn simulations that are run with the same seed produce
the same results, regardless of the operating system or computer.

### Virtual boxes

The box sizes can be left undefined, in which case a default is used, or
they can be defined with either the molperbox or boxsize statements. The
former statement sets the box sizes so that the average number of
molecules per box, at simulation initiation, is close to the requested
number. Good numbers tend to be between 3 and 6, although more or fewer
may be appropriate, depending on how the number of molecules in the
simulation is likely to change over time (the default box size is
computed for an average of 4 molecules per box). The boxsize statement
requests the length of one side of a box, which should be in the same
units that are used for the boundary statements. Either way, the boxes
that are actually created are unlikely to exactly match the requested
values, but are sized to be as close to cubical as possible (or square
for a 2-D simulation) and to exactly fill the simulation volume.

Box sizes that are too large will cause slow simulations, but no errors.
Warnings that say that there are a lot of molecules or surface panels in
a box are suggestions that smaller boxes may make the simulation run
faster, but do not need to be heeded. Box sizes that are too small may
cause errors. Several warnings can be generated for this, including that
the diffusive step lengths are larger than the box size, etc. However,
the only warning that really matters is if box sizes are smaller than
the largest bimolecular reaction binding radius. If this happens, some
bimolecular reactions are likely to be ignored, which will lead to a too
slow reaction rate. If simulation speed is important, it is a good idea
to run a few trial simulations with different box sizes to see which one
leads to the fastest simulations.

The accuracy statement sets which neighboring boxes are checked for
potential bimolecular reactions. Consider the reaction A + B → C and
suppose that A and B are within a binding radius of each other. This
reaction will always be performed if A and B are in the same virtual
box. If accuracy is set to at least 3, then it will also occur if A and
B are in nearest-neighbor virtual boxes. If it is at least 7, then the
reaction will happen if they are in nearest-neighbor boxes that are
separated by periodic boundary conditions. And if it is 9 or 10, then
all edge and corner boxes are checked for reactions, which means that no
potential reactions are overlooked. Overall, increasing accuracy numbers
lead to improved quantitative bimolecular reaction rates, along with
substantially slower simulations. If qualitative simulations are wanted,
then lower accuracy values are likely to be preferable.

### Surface-bound molecule settings

Several settings affect simulation of surface-bound molecules, described
here. The default settings are nearly always good, although they can be
modified if desired.

Molecules that are bound to a surface are given locations that are
extremely close to that surface. However, this position does not need to
be exactly at the surface, and in fact it usually cannot be exactly at
the surface due to round-off error. The tolerance for how far a
surface-bound molecule is allowed to be away from the surface can be set
with the epsilon statement.

When a surface-bound molecule diffuses off of one surface panel, it can
sometimes diffuse onto the neighboring surface panel. It does so only if
the neighboring panel is declared to be a neighbor, as described above
in the surfaces section, and also the neighbor is within a distance that
is set with the neighbor_dist statement. This value is set to an
extremely small value by default, just large enough to prevent round-off
error, and generally should not need changing. In some cases, moving a
molecule to a point that is exactly on a panel edge can cause problems
with round-off errors, so it is actually moved just inside the edge by a
distance that can be set by the margin statement. Again, this should not
need changing.

The following table summarizes the statements for simulation settings.

|            |      |                     |

| random_seed | *int* | random number seed |

## Ports

### Port basics

Ports are data structures that are used for importing and exporting
molecules between a Smoldyn simulation and another simulation. In
particular, they are designed for the incorporation of Smoldyn into
MOOSE, but they could also be used to connect multiple Smoldyn
simulations or for other connections.

A port is essentially a surface and a buffer. Smoldyn molecules that hit
the porting surface are removed from the Smoldyn simulation and are put
into the buffer for export. Once exported, they are removed from the
buffer. Also, molecules may be added to the Smoldyn simulation at the
porting surface by other programs.

### Defining ports

Using the standard format, port statements are given in blocks that
start with start_port and end with end_port. A port name is declared
after start_port. The porting surface is specified with surface and the
active face of that surface is specified with face.

Also, in the definition of the surface that is to be used for porting
(the surface has to be defined first), one has to specify that the
active face of the surface has action `port`.

### Statements about ports

The following table lists statements about ports.

|                   |
|-------------------|
| start_port *name* |
| surface *surface* |
| face *face* |
| end_port |


### Porting rate

Some care is required to make ports work accurately. In particular, a
port behaves for a Smoldyn simulation as an absorbing surface. The
absorption rate depends on the simulation time step and molecular rms
step length, as I described in Andrews, *Physical Biology*, 2009.

## Rule-based Modeling with BioNetGen

### Rule-based modeling basics

In many biochemical systems, proteins bind together into multimeric
complexes and/or can be modified with phosphates, methyls, or other
moieties. Each possible complex or protein state needs to be treated as
a distinct chemical species in Smoldyn, as in many other simulators.
However, even a fairly small list of complexation or modification
reactions can lead to a large number of distinct species, and even more
reactions that interconvert these species, making it impractical to
enumerate all of the species and reactions manually. The solution is
rule-based modeling, in which the user specifies the protein subunits
and their binding rules, and then the software generates the species and
reaction lists.

Smoldyn offers two types of rule-based modeling. First, you can use
wildcards, which are explained in the Molecules chapter. Wildcards are
very convenient but not good for complicated reaction networks.
Secondly, you can use Smoldyn’s BioNetGen module, which uses the
BioNetGen software. This software has been thoroughly validated and is
widely used. BioNetGen generates the entire reaction network at once, as
opposed to `on-the-fly,` in which the network is only expanded as
needed.

To use BioNetGen rule-based modeling with Smoldyn, you need to write a
rules file in the BioNetGen language, called BNGL, and save it as a
plain text file but with a .bngl suffix. Once you have a rules file, you
can either convert it to a reaction network yourself, using the
BioNetGen BNG2.pl program (a perl script), or you can tell Smoldyn to
convert it to a reaction network, which it does by calling the same
BNG2.pl program. The former approach has the advantage of separating the
steps more cleanly, which might be easier for debugging, understanding
the output, or setting up multiple simulations more efficiently. The
latter approach is a little more automated, which might be better for
making the code simpler for yourself or other users. Either way, BNG2.pl
saves the reaction network as a plain text file that has a .net suffix
(which is fairly easy to understand). Then, Smoldyn reads in this
reaction network, adding the generated species and reactions to its
internal lists. During the process, Smoldyn also computes diffusion
coefficients, default states, display colors, display sizes, and
molecule-surface interactions for the new species, as explained below.

### Writing rules in BNGL

The BNGL language is relatively simple to use for most models. The language
also has many more sophisticated portions, for which interested readers should
refer to the [BioNetGen
website](https://www.csb.pitt.edu/Faculty/Faeder/?page_id=409) and publications
by the BioNetGen team; the most relevant publication, which is included in the
documentation directory of the download package, is `**Rule-Based Modeling of
Biochemical Systems with BioNetGen**` by Faeder, Blinov, and Hlavacek, *Methods
in Molecular Biology, Systems Biology* 500:113, 2009.

The following example file is called `abba.bngl`, named for the structure
of the complete complex (A-B-B-A).

```
# BioNetGen file, run in Smoldyn with abbasim.txt
setOption("SpeciesLabel","HNauty")
begin model
begin parameters
    Anumber 100
    Bnumber 100
    kab_on 200
    kab_off 2
    kbb_on 80
    kbb_off 1
end parameters

begin seed species
    A(a2b) Anumber
    B(b2a,b2b) Bnumber
end seed species

begin reaction rules
    # A bind to B
    A(a2b) + B(b2a) <-> A(a2b!1).B(b2a!1) kab_on,kab_off
    # B bind to B
    B(b2b) + B(b2b) <-> B(b2b!1).B(b2b!1) kbb_on,kbb_off
end reaction rules
end model

## actions ##
generate_network({overwrite=>1})
```

The setOption statement tells BioNetGen how to do graph isomorphism
checking. The HNauty method, used here, is always a good approach. The
model definition portion of the file, which is essentially the entire
file, starts with begin model and ends with end model statements. Within
this are three blocks: `parameters` in which you can define the values
of variables, `seed species` in which you define the monomers of the
multimeric complexes and how many the simulation should start with, and
`reaction rules` in which you define the rules for the possible
complexation reactions, along with their reaction rates. Each block
begins with a begin statement and ends with an end statement.

The parameters block defines parameters and lists their values. In the
seed species definitions, each line lists one subunit and all of its
binding sites. Here, the A species has only one binding site, called a2b
and the B species has two binding sites, called b2a and b2b. These
species are followed by the number of molecules to include in the
simulation (which will be randomly placed within the simulation volume).
Although not done here, it is typically easiest to set these molecule
counts to 0 and to then add monomers to the simulation with mol,
surface_mol, or compartment_mol statements in the Smoldyn input file.
The reaction rules describe how things can bind together. In the first
rule, for example, A can bind to B using the a2b site on A molecules and
the b2a site on B molecules. The b2b site of B molecules does not affect
this binding, so it is ignored in the rule (alternatively, this rule
could have specified that the b2b site must be bound, or unbound, for
this reaction to occur). On the right hand side of the rule, the period
between the species indicates a bond and the `!1` text labels the bond
number; this latter notation is useful for distinguishing bonds when
there are multiple bonds in a single rule. Finally, the reaction rate is
followed by forward and reverse reaction rate constants. The last line
of the file tells BioNetGen to generate the network and to overwrite any
previous output file. Note that BioNetGen can also do quite a lot of
other things in addition to simply generating the network, including
running non-spatial simulations; see the BioNetGen documentation for
these.

### Writing the Smoldyn file to read the rules or generated network

The following Smoldyn file reads and simulates the abba network.

```
# Smoldyn configuration file to run abba.bngl BioNetGen network.
# Graphical output

graphics opengl_good
# System space and time definitions
dim 2
boundaries x 0 100 p
boundaries y 0 100 p

# Molecular species and their properties

difc A 3
difc B 1
color A green
color B red
display_size all(all) 2
start_bng abba
multiply unimolecular_rate 1
multiply bimolecular_rate 1

#BNG2_path ../../../source/BioNetGen/BNG2.pl
expand_rules abba.bngl
read_file abba.net
end_bng

text_display time A B A.1.B.1.0 B.2.0 A.1.B.2.0 A.2.B.2.0
end_file
```

This file declares the A and B species with a species statement and then
gives their diffusion coefficients and graphical display parameters.
Later on, while parsing the BioNetGen output, Smoldyn will assign these
same values to the A and B monomers.

The BioNetGen portion of this file is in the `bng` block. It starts with
the start_bng statement and the network name (you can also name the
block using the name statement) and ends with end_bng. Within this
block, Smoldyn recognizes some statements that are specific to Smoldyn,
as well as text from the BioNetGen .net file (i.e. you can just copy and
paste the .net file into here if you like). The multiply statements
shown here enable you to enter factors with which Smoldyn will multiply
the unimolecular or bimolecular reaction rates. This is useful to make
unit conversions in case you used different units for reaction rates in
the rules file and in the rest of the Smoldyn configuration file. The
BNG2_path statement, which is commented out here, specifies the
directory path to the BNG2.pl software. Ideally, the default path (set
to /usr/local/bin for Macs and Linux), will be correct and you won’t
need to specify it here. However, if the default does not work
correctly, then you can give it here instead. The expand_rules
statement, with the filename of the rules file, tells Smoldyn to call
BNG2.pl, which will then expand the reaction network and save the result
as a .net file; Smoldyn does not parse the results at this point.
Finally, read_file is a standard Smoldyn statement, which in this case
reads in the .net file, adding the species and reactions to the
simulation in the process. The last line of this file tells Smoldyn to
display the species counts to the display.

When you run this configuration file in Smoldyn, you should, as always,
look at Smoldyn’s diagnostic text output. In this case, the BioNetGen
portion of the output includes the following:

```text
species allocated: 7, defined: 7
1 A (solution), count: 100, longname: A(a2b)
2 B (solution), count: 100, longname: B(b2a,b2b)
3 A.1.B.1.0 (solution), count: 0, longname: A(a2b!1).B(b2a!1,b2b)
4 B.2.0 (solution), count: 0, longname: B(b2a,b2b!1).B(b2a,b2b!1)
5 A.1.B.2.0 (solution), count: 0, longname: A(a2b!1).B(b2a!1,b2b!2).B(b2a,b2b!2)
6 A.2.B.2.0 (solution), count: 0, longname: A(a2b!1).A(a2b!2).B(b2a!2,b2b!3).B(b2a!1,b2b!3)

reactions allocated: 15, defined: 13
1 A + B -> A.1.B.1.0 rate: 200
2 B + B -> B.2.0 rate: 80
3 A + B.2.0 -> A.1.B.2.0 rate: 400
4 A.1.B.1.0 -> A + B rate: 2
5 B + A.1.B.1.0 -> A.1.B.2.0 rate: 80
6 A.1.B.1.0 + A.1.B.1.0 -> A.2.B.2.0 rate: 80
7 B.2.0 -> B + B rate: 1
8 A + A.1.B.2.0 -> A.2.B.2.0 rate: 200
9 A.1.B.2.0 -> A + B.2.0 rate: 2
10 A.2.B.2.0 -> A + A.1.B.2.0 rate: 4
11 A.1.B.2.0 -> B + A.1.B.1.0 rate: 1
12 A.2.B.2.0 -> A.1.B.1.0 + A.1.B.1.0 rate: 1
```

The species list shows that each species has both a short name and a
long name. The long names were generated by BioNetGen and give the full
binding information. The short names were shortened by Smoldyn for more
convenient use. They list only the numbers of each monomer type in a
species, followed by an `isomer index` in case there are multiple
complexes with the same stoichiometry. The reaction list is shown using
the short names. Note that the reaction rates account correctly for the
species’ binding sites; for example, reaction 3 has rate 400, rather
than the value of 200 that was given in the rules file for A-B binding,
due to the fact that the A molecule in this reaction can bind to either
of two B monomers.

### Creating species groups in BioNetGen

It is often helpful to be able to output not just the number of a
molecules of individual species, but the number of molecules of all
species that share some specific property. For example, one might want
the total number of molecules that include at least one AB group,
independent of what else is bound to them. To do so, you can define a
species group using an `observables` section in the BNGL file. These
observables become species groups in the main Smoldyn program, as
described above the in the Molecules chapter. Each observable needs to
have a name and then a species pattern that tells which species are
included. For example, adding these lines to the ABBA.bngl file would
create a species group called ABgroup:

```
begin observables
    Species ABgroup A(a2b!1).B(b2a!1)
end observables
```

Species groups defined in this way can be used in most Smoldyn statements and
commands.

### Statements for rule-based modeling

The following list summarizes the statements for rule-based modeling.

```
start_bng *name*
end_bng
name *name*
multiply unimolecular_rate *value*
multiply bimolecular_rate *value*
monomer_state *monomer state*
BNG2_path *path*
bng_file *filename*
```

### A ligand-receptor-messenger system in BioNetGen

The following BioNetGen and Smoldyn files represent a
ligand-receptor-messenger signaling system. In it, both an extracellular
ligand and an intracellular messenger protein can bind to opposite sides
of a trans-membrane receptor. When a receptor binds both at once, it
causes the messenger to become phosphorylated, thus transmitting the
ligand-binding event to an intracellular signal. The messenger protein
dephosphorylates spontaneously. This is substantially more complicated
than the above ABBA simulation because it uses monomer modification
sites and surface-bound molecules. The following sections discuss these
files.

### Network expansion with monomer modifications

Monomers can have modification sites, such as sites that can accept
phosphate or methyl groups. Using these modification sites can be
preferable to treating them as complexation reactions with phosphate or
methyl molecules because doing so avoids needing to treat the additional
molecules explicitly.

Enter modification sites in the BNGL language by defining the monomers
in a `molecule types` block. This block is optional when not using
modification sites. In this block, list the different monomers, along
with their binding sites. List modification sites similarly to binding
sites, but follow the site name with a sequence of tildes and the
possible modifications. In the lrm example, M(m2r,psite\~u\~p) declares
the monomer M, which has a binding site called m2r and a modification
site called psite. This modification site can adopt either the ‘u’ or
the ‘p’ condition. In this case, the seed species block specifies that
network expansion should start with unphosphorylated M using
M(m2r,psite~u), but does not include phosphorylated M.

The molecule types and seed species blocks appear to be essentially the
same, but aren’t actually. The molecule types block is used to define
each of the *monomers*, including all of their binding sites and
modification sites. The seed species block includes a list of *species*
(which are typically, but not necessarily monomeric). When expanding the
reaction network, BioNetGen starts with each of these seed species,
finds their reactions and reaction products, then finds the reactions
and products of the newly generated species, and so on, eventually
generating the entire reaction network. If a portion of the network
cannot be reached from the given list of seed species, then BioNetGen
does not generate it. Nevertheless, there is high overlap between the
two blocks, which is why the molecule types block is optional when there
are no modification sites.

Note the use of modification sites in the reaction rules. Also, the
third reaction rule has the reactant
R(r2l!+,r2m!1).M(m2r!1,psite\~u). The notation !+ indicates that the
r2l site needs to be bound to something, but does not specify the
binding partner.

Smoldyn interprets modification sites as creating different isomers of a
species. For this reason, there is no species called just M in this
simulation, because it would be unclear which modification state that
would represent. Instead, the two species are M.1.0 and M.1.1, where the
former 1 denotes that there is 1 M monomer and the latter 0 or 1 denotes
the isomer number (which, in this case, corresponds to the ‘u’ and the
‘p’ condition, respectively). This Smoldyn file defines the diffusion
coefficient, color, and display size for both M isomers, which are then
used in the simulation. If the file did not define them, Smoldyn would
have looked for these attributes for a species named M or one called
M.*x*.*y*, where *x* and *y* are any numbers, and used those instead.

## Network expansion with surface-bound states

The lrm simulation also uses surface-bound states. These do not appear
in the BioNetGen file at all. Instead, they show up in the Smoldyn file
in a couple of places. First, trivially, they are used in the diffusion
coefficient and graphical display statements, where they ensure that the
attributes get assigned to the correct states of the species. They also
appear in the bng block, in the monomer_state statement. This specifies
the state (solution, `bsoln,` or a surface-bound state) in which each
monomer is typically found. Smoldyn uses these to infer states for
reaction products.

For example, this file says that ligands are in `fsoln` state, receptors
in the up state, and messenger proteins in the `bsoln` state. From these,
Smoldyn assigns states to some of the reactions as:

```
L + R (up) -> L.1.R.1.0 (up)
L.1.R.1.0 (up) -> L + R (up)
R (up) + M.1.0 (bsoln) -> M.1.R.1.0 (up)
M.1.R.1.0 (up) -> R (up) + M.1.0 (bsoln)
```

Smoldyn uses the method that the state for a species is the highest
precedence of the states for the species’ subunits. In the first
reaction, for example, the species L.1.R.1.0 has an L monomer with state
fsoln and an R monomer with state up, and the up state takes precedence,
so the species is assigned state up. The precedence order is: solution,
`bsoln,` and then surface-bound states in the order front, back, up,
and down.

### Short names, diffusion coefficients, and graphical parameters

Smoldyn assigns short names to each species that BioNetGen generates. As
mentioned briefly above, the format is that it lists each monomer and
the number of copies of that monomer in the species, and then an isomer
number at the end, with the items separated by periods. Smoldyn gets the
monomer names from the species’ long names, which BioNetGen generates.
The monomers are listed in alphabetical order. If a species has only a
single monomer in it and there are no modification sites for this
monomer, then Smoldyn abbreviates the short name to just the same name
as the monomer. Note that a monomer and a species that has just a single
monomer can have the same names and are chemically identical, but are
conceptually different in the software; one is a monomer, which only
exists in the context of parsing BioNetGen files, and the other is a
species, which is part of a Smoldyn simulation. Smoldyn assigns isomer
numbers based on the order in which it encounters the species in the
BioNetGen output file. Thus, there is no a priori way to know what the
isomer number will be. The best approach is to figure out which is which
by reading the long name portion of the bng output.

For each monomer, Smoldyn looks for information with which it can assign
diffusion coefficients and graphical parameters. First, it sees whether
the user assigned these using monomer_difc, monomer_color, or
monomer_display_size statements (very similar to the monomer_state
statement). If not, Smoldyn sees whether the user created a species that
has the same name as the monomer, and then uses its attributes. If this
fails, then Smoldyn sees whether there is a species that has the monomer
name followed by a .*x*.*y* suffix, where *x* and *y* are additional
text, and uses its attributes. If all of these fail, then Smoldyn simply
assigns the monomer diffusion coefficient to 0, the color to black, and
the display size to 0.

For species, Smoldyn again starts by looking for definitions given in
the input file. If none were given, then it computes diffusion
coefficients and graphics parameters based upon the values for the
monomers that compose the species. In doing so, it assumes that the mass
of a species is the sum of the monomer masses and also that both
monomers and complexes of monomers are roughly spherical and have
similar densities. From these assumptions, the radius of a complex is
the cube root of the sum of the cubes of the monomer radii. Based on
this, Smoldyn assigns a species display size as

$$S_{species} = \left( \sum_i S_i^3 \right)^{\frac{1}{3}}$$

where S~i~ is the display size of the i’th monomer. Smoldyn
also assumes that the diffusion coefficient scales as the inverse of the
species radius, from the Stokes-Einstein equation. From this, it
computes the diffusion coefficient for a complex using

where $D_i$ is the diffusion coefficient of the i'th
monomer. Smoldyn computes colors for species by computing the arithmetic
average of the red, green, and blue color values for each of the
monomers.

$$D_{species}=\left(\sum_i D_i^{-3} \right)^{-1/3}$$

### Surface-molecule interactions

If your block of BioNetGen statements comes before your surface
definitions in your Smoldyn input file, then all of the species will
have been generated before Smoldyn starts defining surfaces. In this
case, you can set surface actions or rates for the newly generated
species yourself. In the surface action or rate statements, you can list
these species individually, all at once using the `all` option, or
selectively using species groups or wildcards.

The other option is to define surfaces before expanding the reaction
network with BioNetGen. In this case, Smoldyn infers the
molecule-surface interactions for the newly generated species, much as
Smoldyn computes diffusion coefficients, colors, and display sizes for
them. As for those other species properties, Smoldyn considers the
monomers that compose the new species and looks at the molecule-surface
interactions for those monomeric species. The surface action for a
multimeric complex is that of the component monomer that has the
greatest action. In order of increasing action, the possibilities are:
transmit, multiple actions, reflect, jump, absorb, and port. Multiple
actions mean that there is some rate, such as for adsorption or
desorption. If Smoldyn needs to choose between two monomers with
multiple actions, then Smoldyn chooses the one with the faster rate
constant. The polymer_endsim.txt file illustrates this, although in a
fairly minimal manner.

## Filaments

### Status

I am working on adding simulation support for filaments to Smoldyn, but
have only just begun. At present, it is possible to define filaments and
specify their geometries by adding monomers to them. These filaments can
move by treadmilling, and they interact with surfaces. They do not
exhibit Brownian motion. See the examples in the S13_filaments
directory.

## Hybrid Simulation

Most of the Smoldyn software is developed around the Smoluchowski level
of detail. Here, each individual molecule of interest in the simulation
is represented as a small sphere that has a precisely defined position
in continuous space. This offers spatial accuracy down to nanometer size
scales for typical systems, which is more detailed than that offered by
most other comparable simulation software, but is necessary when
studying biophysical processes that take place on these spatial scales.
The cost of this high level of detail is that simulations become
computationally demanding, both in terms of the number of processes that
have to be run at each simulation time step and in terms of the memory
required to store all of the molecular information. Hybrid simulations
can offer solutions for simulating models with both high levels of
detail and high speed, which they accomplish by representing high levels
of detail only as needed.

The hybrid methods that are particularly important here combine
particle-based simulation with lattice-based simulation. The
particle-based simulation methods are Smoldyn’s standard methods, which
work at the Smoluchowski level of detail. The lattice-based methods
represent spatially compartmentalized versions of the chemical master
equation, typically simulated using one of the spatial Gillespie methods
(partial differential equations or spatial Langevin methods are also
appropriate). Hybrid methods can use either overlapping space or
adjacent space methods. In the former case, the physical space
represented by the lattice-based methods is the same as that by the
particle-based methods; molecules in one representation can interact
with spatially proximate molecules that are in the other representation.
Smoldyn has been added to Virtual Cell in this manner, where VCell
provides the lattice representation and Smoldyn provides the particle
representation. Here, the lattice representation is best for abundant or
rapidly diffusing species where exact molecule positions don’t matter,
and the particle representation for rare species where the extra
computational effort is necessary. In the latter case, the
particle-based and lattice-based methods represent adjacent regions of
physical space. Molecules can diffuse back and forth between the two
regions, changing representations as they do so. This approach is best
in cases where one region of space needs to be simulated in detail,
while surrounding regions can be simulated more coarsely. The remainder
of this section focuses on this latter adjacent space approach.

### Hybrid simulation basics

The lattice module incorporated into Smoldyn is fairly simple. It
represents lattices using an axis-aligned rectangular array of
subvolumes. It simulates chemical reactions using the next subvolume
(NSV) method, which treats molecules as discrete objects (i.e. not
continuously variable concentrations) and captures reaction
stochasticity accurately. Whereas simulation time advances with fixed
length time steps in the particle-based methods, it advances with
unequal steps, from event to event, in the NSV method. The lattice
region of space can be bounded by a few different boundary types, but
the lattice code does not currently address interactions between
molecules and any surfaces that are within the lattice region of space.
The junction between the particle-based region of space and the lattice
region of space is created using a Smoldyn `port`, explained above.

### Defining lattices

To include a lattice in a model, you need to add a lattice, obviously.
This is entered using a block of statements that starts with
start_lattice and ends with end_lattice, much like similar blocks for
surfaces, compartments, and other things. The definitions that can be
entered within this block are discussed below. In addition to adding a
lattice, you also need to define a port, which will form the junction
between the particle space and the lattice space. And to create a port,
you will need to define at least one surface. The
examples/S14_lattices/diffusion.txt file shows a very simple example of
model that uses a lattice.

First, it’s a good idea to define the lattice type using the type
statement. In principle, this will enable you to choose whether the
lattice region is simulated with discrete numbers of molecules using NSV
algorithm, with continuous concentrations using PDE algorithms, or with
other methods. In practice though, only NSV is currently implemented,
and NSV is the default, so you don’t actually need to define the type.
On the other hand, you do need to define the port that separates
particle space from lattice space, using the port statement.

Define the boundaries of the lattice space using the boundaries
statement. It is essentially identical to the boundaries statement for
the main portion of the configuration file, but that one only applies to
the particle region of space and this one only applies to the lattice
region of space. The two sets of boundaries are typically strictly
adjacent to each other, with no gap and no overlap, but it is also just
fine if they overlap. The port should obviously be at the intersection
of the two sets of boundaries, or somewhere within the overlap region.
By default the lattice boundaries are reflective, but they can also be
periodic. These are entered with optional characters after the rest of
the statement, exactly as for the particle side boundaries statement.

Lattice partitioning is defined using the lengthscale statement. The
values entered here should be even divisors of the boundaries
dimensions. Also, make sure that the port is at a partition boundary and
make sure that there is at least one partition on either side of the
port. Note that misalignments can arise from round-off errors. To avoid
this, use boundaries, port positions, and lattice compartment sizes that
are integers, or that use an integer power of two decimal (e.g. 0.5,
0.25, 0.375, etc., but not 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, etc.).

Use the species and reactions statements to tell a lattice which species
and reactions it should work with. Often, `all` is used, meaning that
the lattice should know about all of the same species and/or reactions
as the particle side of the simulation uses. However, it’s also possible
to specify a subset of the total species and reactions lists. This is
useful because the lattice code runtime increases with more species and
with more reactions, unlike the particle side, which increases with
numbers of individual molecules. Lattices cannot work with any species
or reactions that are not also defined in the particle side. However, it
is possible to have a reaction only perform on the lattice side. In this
case, define the reaction on the particle side, with a rate constant as
usual. Then, when listing the reactions that the lattice side should
work with, use the keyword `move` to indicate that all subsequent
reactions in the list should be `moved` to the lattice side and disabled
on the particle side.

Finally, use the mol statement to add molecules to the lattice side.
This is essentially identical to the statement of the same name in the
main portion of the configuration file, but only applies to the lattice
side of space.

### Lattice output

Several commands output information from lattices. printLattice outputs
some basic information about the lattice, including the low and high
corners of the lattice space, the subvolume partition spacing, and the
total number of each species in the lattice. This is the same output
that is displayed with the simulation diagnostics.

molcount and molcountspace are functions that are often used with
non-lattice simulations. In addition to counting molecules in the
particle region of space, they also count molecules in the lattice
region; there is no way to select just particle region or just lattice
region. molcountspace does not count molecules that are in transit
between representations (if you select a single species and state; it
does if you select all species and/or all states), so it will miss a few
molecules. savesim saves the full simulation state; it saves the lattice
state as well as the rest. Other molecule counting commands do not
include lattice molecules.

Finally, `writeVTK` produces VTK output for both the particle and lattice
regions of space. It does not include surface information. The output is
saved as a stack of files that have names that follow the format
`Lattice00_00001.vtu` and `Molecules00001.vtu`, and
that have incremented numbers for subsequent snapshots. This output can
be viewed using Paraview, Visit, or other VTK viewers. It doesn’t appear
that any of them are trivial to use.
