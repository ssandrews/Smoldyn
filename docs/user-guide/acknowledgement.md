Prior to my starting Smoldyn, I attended an M-Cell workshop taught by
Joel Stiles and Tom Bartoll, where I learned several of the concepts
that became incorporated in the program. I started writing Smoldyn while
I was a post-doc in Dennis Bray’s laboratory at the University of
Cambridge and funded by NIGMS grant GM64713. I made further additions
during my next post-doc in Adam Arkin’s laboratory at the Lawrence
Berkeley National Laboratory, where I was funded by the Genomes to Life
Project of the US Department of Energy and an NSF post-doctoral
fellowship in biological informatics. Next, I made a lot of progress
during my stay as a visiting scientist in Upi Bhalla’s lab at the
National Centre for Biological Research, in Bangalore, where I was
funded by the Computer Research Laboratories (Pune, India). I made
further additions as part of my work as a research fellow at the
Molecular Sciences Institute, where I was funded by grants from the NIH
and the MITRE corporation that were awarded to Roger Brent. Yet more
additions were made during work as a staff scientist in Roger Brent’s
laboratory at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and funded by
MITRE contracts and NIH grants to Roger Brent.
