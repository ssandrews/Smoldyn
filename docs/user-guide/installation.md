title: Installing Smoldyn
---

## Macintosh

1. At the Smoldyn download webpage, <http://www.smoldyn.org/download.html>,
   download the latest Mac version.
2. Open your `Terminal` application, which is in your Applications/Utilities
   directory.
3. Change directories to this download directory (probably type `cd
   Desktop/smoldyn-2.xx-mac`, or something similar).
4. Type `sudo ./install.sh` and enter your computer password when prompted. If
   you are asked whether you want the installer to update your environment
   `PATH` variable, you should generally say yes (enter `y`).  This will add
   the directory `/usr/local/bin` to the list of places where your computer
   will look for executable files, which means that it will find Smoldyn
   correctly.
5. Test Smoldyn by typing `smoldyn examples/S1\_intro/bounce3.txt`.


!!! fail "If installation failed"

    Type `smoldyn -V`. This should run Smoldyn just enough to print out the
    version number. If this works, then you have Smoldyn and it runs, but
    Smoldyn wasn’t finding the input file.

    __Did the Smoldyn software get installed to the correct place?__
    Check by typing `ls /usr/local/bin` and see if smoldyn is in the directory.

    __Does your computer know where to look for programs?__
    Type `echo $PATH` to get a list of colon-separated places where the
    computer looks. If `/usr/local/bin` isn't in this list, then you need to
    add it to your profile file ([Google `edit path
    mac`](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=edit+path+mac))

    __Is your system allowing you to run the code?__ If you're told that
    permission was denied for running smoldyn, then your computer might not
    have realized that Smoldyn is an executable program. Enter `sudo chmod +x
    /usr/local/bin/smoldyn`.

    E-mail <support@smoldyn.org> for assistance.

## Windows

1. At the Smoldyn download webpage, <http://www.smoldyn.org/download.html>,
   download the latest Windows version. Your browser may warn you about the
   dangers of downloading software, but this file is almost certainly ok; I
   compiled it on a clean Windows computer using only files that I wrote myself
   and a few widely used libraries, so it is extremely unlikely that there is a
   virus in it.

 __If you have administrator privileges__

2. Extract the zip file. Do this by right-clicking on the icon of the
   downloaded file and selecting `extract to smoldyn-2.xx-windows`. This
   should extract the file to your home directory.

3. Open a `Command Prompt` application as administrator. You can find the
   command prompt by searching for it with the Start menu. Rather than
   left-clicking on the Command prompt result that appears, right click on it,
   and select `run as administrator.` The computer emits scary warnings, but
   reply yes anyhow.

4. Change directories to the Smoldyn directory (probably type `cd
   Downloads/smoldyn-2.xx-windows`, or something similar).

5. Type `install`. This will copy the Smoldyn files to a new Smoldyn
   subdirectory of your `C:\\Program Files` directory. This will also update
   your `%PATH%` environment variable so your computer knows where to find the
   software. Note that it is possible for the installer to corrupt your `PATH`
   variable if it was unusually long (about 1024 characters). If this happens,
   revert the variable using the file `PATH_old.txt`, where the installer saves
   the existing `PATH` variable before modifying it.

6. Exit the command prompt as administrator, and start a new command
   prompt, not as administrator.

7. Test Smoldyn by typing `smoldyn examples/S1\_intro/bounce3.txt`.

__If you don’t have administrator privileges__

2. Extract the zip file to the desired location. Do this by right-clicking
   on the icon of the downloaded file and selecting `extract file...` and
   then enter the directory where you want the file.

3. Open a `Command Prompt` application. You can find it by searching for it
   with the Start menu.

4. In the Command Prompt, change directories to the Smoldyn download (use
   `cd` to change directories, and `dir` to list directory contents).

5. Test Smoldyn by typing `smoldyn examples/S1\_intro/bounce3.txt`.  Smoldyn
   should work just as well as if it was installed, but you will need to be in
   this directory to run it.

!!! fail "If installation failed"

    If you get errors due to missing dll files, look in the dll directory in
    the Smoldyn download. If the needed dll file is in there, then simply copy
    it to the same directory where the smoldyn.exe file is. E-mail
    <support@smoldyn.org> for assistance.

## Compiling Smoldyn

### Compiling on Macintosh

1. You will need a C compiler and the Make utility. To check if you have them,
   simply type `gcc` at a shell prompt. If it says `command not found`, then
   you need to get it. To get it, go to http://developer.apple.com/xcode and
   click on the `view in Mac App store button` to be taken to the Xcode site in
   the Mac App store. Then, click on the `Free` button, register for a free
   Apple Developer Connection account if you don’t have one already, and click
   on the same button, which is now called `Install App`. This will install
   XCode. However, it still won’t work properly. Next, start XCode and go to
   the `Preferences...` menu item, click on `downloads` and install the
   `Command line tools`.
2. OpenGL should already be installed on your computer. To check, type `ls
   /System/Library/Frameworks` and you should see folders called GLUT.framework
   and OpenGL.framework. If they aren’t there, then you’ll need to get them.
3. You will need the CMake configuration software. To see if you already have
   it, type `cmake`; this will produce the help information if you have it, or
   an error message if not. If you don’t have it, you need to download and
   install it.
4. Libtiff is a library that Smoldyn uses for saving tiff format images, which
   you probably do not have. It is not required for Smoldyn to run, but it
   necessary to save images. One way to install Libtiff is to download it from
   http://www.libtiff.org, uncompress it, and install it. To install it, start
   a terminal window, change to the libtiff directory, and follow the README
   instructions: type `./configure`, then `make`, then `sudo make install` and
   your password. This will install libtiff header files to /usr/local/include
   and libtiff library archives in /usr/local/lib.

!!! tip "Installing libtiff using MacPorts"

    Another method (but one which I think is harder) is to use MacPorts or Fink.
    For MacPorts, type `port search libtiff`. If you get the error message 
    `port: command not found`, then you don’t have MacPorts. If this is the case, then you
    can get MacPorts from <www.macports.org> and try again. When the command works,
    it should list a few packages, one of which is called `tiff @3.8.2 (graphics)`,
    or something very similar.  Install it by typing `sudo port install tiff`,
    followed by your password. This will install libtiff to
    `/opt/local/var/macports/software/`. 
    
    This is great, except that the Smoldyn build system prefers for libtiff to
    be in `/usr/local/lib`. The solution is to set `LIBTIFF_CFLAGS` and
    `LIBTIFF_LDFLAGS` manually when you type `./configure` for Smoldyn. This will
    override Smoldyn’s search for the libraries and will link them in properly.
    For Fink, exactly the same advice applies, except that Fink installs
    libraries to `/sw`. For example, if libtiff is installed to `/sw/local`, then
    configure with: 
    
    ```
    $ LIBTIFF_CFLAGS="-I/sw/local/include" LIBTIFF_LDFLAGS="-L/sw/local/lib -ltiff" ./configure
    ```

5. Install Smoldyn by changing to the `cmake` directory. Then type `cmake ..`,
   then `make`, and then `sudo make install`, and finally your password. Some
   custom installation options can be selected with the `cmake ..` line if you
   want them; they are listed below in the sections on installing to a custom
   location and on installation problems, and also in the Smoldyn programmers
   manual. To clean up temporary files, *which is essential if you want to try
   building a second time*, first enter `pwd` and confirm that you are still in
   the `cmake/` directory (don’t continue if not\!). Then, type `rm -r \*` to
   clear out all prior build stuff.

6. Test Smoldyn
    - Type `smoldyn -V` to just print out the Smoldyn version number. If it
       doesn’t work, then the most likely problem is that your system is not
       set up to run programs that are in your /usr/local/bin directory, which
       is where Smoldyn is installed by default. To fix this temporarily, type
       `export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin`; to fix it permanently, although it
       will only take effect after you open a new terminal window, use emacs or
       some other editor to edit the file \~/.profile and add the line `export
       PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin`.
    - Type `smoldyn examples/S8\_reactions/lotvolt/lotvolt.txt` to run a
       Lotka-Volterra simulation. If a graphics window doesn’t appear, then the
       OpenGL linking somehow failed. Otherwise, press ‘T’ (upper-case) at some
       point during the simulation to save a tiff-format image of the graphical
       display. If it works, it will be saved to the current directory as
       OpenGL001.tif; if not, then the libtiff linking somehow failed.

### Compiling options

Various building options are possible with the CMake build system, of which the
most important are as follows. In all cases, append these to the `cmake ..`
command.

- `-DOPTION_STATIC=ON` Build using static libraries
- `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=...` Choose CMake build type
    options are:
    - None
    - Debug
    - Release (default)
    - RelWithDebInfo
    - MinSizeRel
- `-DOPTION_USE_OPENGL=OFF` Build without graphics support
- `-DOPTION_USE_LIBTIFF=OFF` Build without LibTiff support
- `-DOPTION_USE_ZLIB=OFF` Build without ZLib support
- `-OPTION_TARGET_SMOLDYN=OFF` Don’t build stand-alone Smoldyn program
- `-DOPTION_TARGET_LIBSMOLDYN=ON` Build LibSmoldyn library
- `-DOPTION_NSV=ON` Build with next subvolume support
- `-DOPTION_VTK=ON` Build with VTK output support

By default, the Smoldyn build system installs Smoldyn to either the `/usr` or the
`/usr/local` directories, depending on your system. These are the standard places
for programs like Smoldyn, but you will need root access for the installation
(typically only system administrators have the necessary `su` or `sudo` access to
install to these locations). If you use a computer on a shared computer, you
may not have this access. If this is the case, then you will have to pick a
different install directory, such as `~/usr`. There are standard options to
configure Smoldyn to install here, for the CMake build system

The drawback to installing in a non-standard location is that your system may
not find Smoldyn when you try to run it. To solve this, you need to add the
directory `~/usr`, or wherever you installed Smoldyn, to your `PATH` variable.
This is explained above in instruction 5a for the regular Macintosh
installation, except that here you would add `export PATH=$PATH:~/usr/bin`.

### Compiling on a UNIX/Linux system

For the most part, installing on a UNIX or Linux system is the same as for
Macintosh, described above. Following are a few Linux-specific notes.

To download Smoldyn from a command line, type `wget
http://www.smoldyn.org/smoldyn-2.xx.tar.gz`, where the `xx` is the current
version number. Then unpack it with `tar xzvf smoldyn-2.xx.tar.gz`.

For a full installation, you will need OpenGL and Libtiff. I don’t know how to
install them for all systems, but it turned out to be easy for my Fedora
release 7. I already had OpenGL, but not the OpenGL glut library nor Libtiff.
To install them, I entered `sudo yum install freeglut-devel` and `sudo yum
install libtiff`, respectively, along with my password.

Ubuntu systems are slightly more finicky than others. First, you may
need to install several things as follows. Install a C++ compiler with
`sudo apt-get install g++`, install a Python header file with `sudo
apt-get install python-dev`, install the OpenGL glut library with `sudo
apt-get install freeglut3-dev`, and install the libtiff library with
`sudo apt-get install libtiff4-dev`.

### Running Smoldyn remotely

It can be helpful to have Smoldyn installed on computer A and run from
computer B. Running Smoldyn without graphics is trivial. Just ssh into
computer A as normal, and run Smoldyn with `smoldyn filename.txt -t`,
where the -t flag implies text-only operation. If you want graphics
though, then log in with `ssh -Y me@compA/directory` and run Smoldyn as
normal. Graphics will be slow but should be functional.

Alternatively, I’ve found the free software TeamViewer to be a convenient
method for working on computers remotely. An advantage of this method is that
it works even if there are institutional firewalls that prohibit remote
computer access.
