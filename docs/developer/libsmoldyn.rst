About libsmoldyn
================

``libsmoldyn`` is a C and C++ interface to the Smoldyn simulator.
``libsmoldyn`` is complementary to the stand-alone Smoldyn program in
that it is a little more difficult to use, but it provides much more
flexibility. In addition, ``libsmoldyn`` provides:

1. an application programming interface that will be relatively stable,
   even as Smoldyn is updated and improved,
2. function names that are relatively sensible and that shouldn’t
   collide with other function names in other software, and
3. reasonably thorough error checking in every function which helps
   ensure that the user is using the function in a sensible way and in a
   way that won’t crash Smoldyn.

I initially planned to use SWIG to provide ``libsmoldyn`` access from
several languages but have not pursued this recently. Carlos Lopez’s
group was adding ``libsmoldyn`` to PySB for a while, to give it Python
accessibility, although that project is not ongoing currently.

``libsmoldyn`` only barely supports graphics at present due to
constraints imposed by the glut code library. This will be improved in a
future version (by changing to the freeglut library, which doesn’t
insist on controlling the main event loop, as the glut library does).

Compiling and linking
=====================

Compiling
---------

**Header files**

To enable a C or C++ program to call ``libsmoldyn``, it has to include the
``libsmoldyn`` header file. ``libsmoldyn`` comes with one header file,
``libsmoldyn.h``, which has function declarations for all of the ``libsmoldyn``
functions. For most ``libsmoldyn`` applications, this is the only header file
that you will need to include. For Mac and Linux, it is typically installed to
/usr/local/include. This is one of the standard system paths, so include it
with

.. code:: c

   #include "libsmoldyn.h"

If the ``libsmoldyn.h`` header file is in some other directory or if
your system isn’t seeing its path as a system path, then include the
file using double quotes rather than angle brackets and/or include more
information about the path. For example,

.. code:: c

   #include "libsmoldyn.h"

``libsmoldyn.h`` calls a second header file, ``smoldyn.h``, which is
also typically installed to ``/usr/local/include/``. If you plan to
access the Smoldyn data structure directly, then you will also need to
include it with ``#include <smoldyn.h>``. In general, it is safe to read
from this data structure but it can be dangerous to write to it unless
you really know what you are doing. Also, working with this data
structure directly bypasses one of the benefits of using ``libsmoldyn``,
which is that the interface should be relatively immune to future
Smoldyn developments, because different aspects of the internal data
structure get changed once in a while.

The ``smoldyn.h`` header calls yet another header file,
``smoldynconfigure.h``, which is also installed by default in
``/usr/local/include/``. That file is automatically generated by the
build system. It describes what Smoldyn components are included in the
build, what system the build was compiled for, etc. This might be
helpful to include for some applications.

Compiling example
-----------------

In the ``examples/S97_libsmoldyn/testcode/`` directory, you’ll find the
testcode.c program. To compile this source code to object code, enter:

.. code:: bash

   $ gcc -Wall -O0 -g -c testcode.c

The compile flags ``-O0 -g`` aren’t necessary but can be useful for
debugging purposes. If compiling doesn’t work at this stage, it’s
probably because you’re missing the header files. Make sure that you
have libsmoldyn.h, smoldyn.h, and smoldyn_config.h in the
``/usr/local/include`` directory.

Linking
-------

Linking the different object files together to create an executable that
actually runs is often one of the greatest frustrations of using
software libraries. It should be easy but usually isn’t.

The ``libsmoldyn`` library can be linked statically, meaning that the
``libsmoldyn`` code will be copied into the final result, or it can be
linked dynamically, so that the final result will simply reference the
``libsmoldyn`` code that is stored separately. Dynamic linking is
somewhat more elegant in that it doesn’t create unnecessary copies of
the compiled code. It can also be easier. On the other hand, it’s less
convenient if you plan to distribute your software, because then you
need to make sure that you distribute the ``libsmoldyn`` header file and
library code along with your own software. Also, I can only get the gdb
debugger to help find errors within ``libsmoldyn`` if the library is
statically linked.

The ``libsmoldyn`` static library is called libsmoldyn_static.a and the
``libsmoldyn`` dynamic library is called libsmoldyn_shared.so (on Linux;
the .so suffix is replaced by .dylib on a Mac and by .dll on Windows).
By default, these libraries are installed to /usr/local/lib/.

Linking examples
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Following are several example for static and dynamic linking. They are
shown for C; if you used C++, then link with g++ instead of gcc. The
linking options for Smoldyn compiled with OpenGL are shown for
Macintosh; these lines are simpler for other systems.

I have had a hard time getting static linking working on a Mac, although
apparently it works fine on Ubuntu. The problem is that it doesn’t find
the standard C++ library. The solution is to build the Smoldyn library
without NSV, so that the standard C++ library isn’t needed. I also
commented out a few ``throw`` statements from smolsim.c and libsmoldyn.c
for this purpose.

Static link, no OpenGL:

.. code:: bash

   $ gcc testcode.o /usr/local/lib/libsmoldyn_static.a -o testcode

Static link, with OpenGL:

.. code:: bash

   $ gcc testcode.o /usr/local/lib/libsmoldyn_static.a  \
       -I/System/Library/Frameworks/OpenGL.framework/Headers \
       -I/System/Library/Frameworks/GLUT.framework/Headers -framework GLUT \
       -framework OpenGL -framework Cocoa \
        -L/System/Library/Frameworks/OpenGL.framework/Libraries -o testcode \
       -ltiff

Dynamic link, no OpenGL:

.. code:: bash

   $ gcc testcode.o -o testcode -lsmoldyn_shared`

Dynamic link, with OpenGL:

.. code:: bash

   $ gcc test1.o -L/usr/local/lib \
        -I/System/Library/Frameworks/OpenGL.framework/Headers \
        -I/System/Library/Frameworks/GLUT.framework/Headers -framework GLUT \
        -framework OpenGL -framework Cocoa \
        -L/System/Library/Frameworks/OpenGL.framework/Libraries -o test1 \
        -lsmoldyn_shared -ltiff

Using smaller versions of ``libsmoldyn``
----------------------------------------

As a default, Smoldyn and ``libsmoldyn`` are compiled with all of their
components. However, they can also be compiled without OpenGL, without
hybrid simulation (NSV) support, without LibTiff support, etc. Removing
these components removes some aspects of the functionality, obviously,
but can also simplify linking.

Following is a simple diagram for Smoldyn’s code dependencies. Each file
depends on the files that are indented below it.

-  Smoldyn
-  OpenGL
-  libTiff
-  zlib
-  libiconv
-  NSV
-  boost
-  VTK

To build with fewer components, you will need to run CMake to compile
Smoldyn. This is described in more detail in the Smoldyn Code
Documentation, but summarized here for convenience.

I prefer to run CMake from a command line interface. At a command line
interface, change directories to cmake. Every time you change CMake
settings, you’ll probably want to do a clean build. To do so, enter
``rm -r *``, while in the cmake directory (verify that you’re in this
directory!), to remove any prior build results. If you’re asked about
whether m\ ``anifest.txt`` should be removed, say yes; this file shows
the directories where Smoldyn was installed previously, thus providing
information for you to remove it. For a default build, enter
``cmake ..`` A few test results will be printed out, and then
configuring will be complete. When CMake is done, it will have written a
lot of stuff to the cmake directory. Important files are ``Makefile``,
which is the standard Makefile for the code and also
``smoldynconfigure.h``, which is a C header file that the Smoldyn code
uses for knowing what some important build parameters are.

Once configuring is complete, enter ``make``. Hopefully, Smoldyn will
build, again with build files being put into the cmake directory.
Finally, enter ``sudo make install`` and enter your password, to install
Smoldyn to the usual place (``/usr/local/bin`` on Linux and Mac
systems).

For custom builds, you need to set various options to non-default
settings. With a command line interface, list each non-default option on
the command line after the ``cmake ..`` start. Following are some
helpful build options:

For example, the following line builds Smoldyn and ``libsmoldyn`` for
debugging and without the hybrid simulation support:

.. code:: bash

   $ cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DOPTION_TARGET_LIBSMOLDYN=ON -DOPTION_NSV=OFF

Error trapping
---------------

Every function in ``libsmoldyn`` checks that its input values are
acceptable and also that no errors arise in the function execution.
These errors are returned to the host library in a number of ways. Most
``libsmoldyn`` functions (e.g. ``smolRunSim``) return any error codes
directly, which makes it easy to see if an error arose. However, a few
functions (e.g. ``smolNewSim``) return other types of values and so
return some other indication of success or failure (e.g. ``NULL``). In
addition, some functions can raise warnings, which indicate that
behavior is unusual but not incorrect.

For all of these errors and warnings, get the details of the problem
using the function ``smolGetError``, which will return the error code,
the name of the function where the error arose, and a descriptive error
string. This will also clear the error, if desired. If errors are not
cleared, they are left until they are overwritten by subsequent errors.
Warnings are also left until they are cleared or overwritten.

When writing code, it can be helpful to put ``libsmoldyn`` into its
debugging mode using the ``smolSetDebugMode`` function. Doing this
causes any errors that arise to be displayed to stderr.

The possible error codes are declared in libsmoldyn.h with:

.. code:: c

   enum ErrorCode {ECok=0,ECnotify=-1,ECwarning=-2,ECnonexist=-3,ECall=-4,ECmissing=-5,ECbounds=-6,ECsyntax=-7,ECerror=-8,ECmemory=-9,ECbug=-10,ECsame=-11};

Their interpretations are:

+-------+----------------+-------------------------------------------+
| value | code           | interpretation                            |
+=======+================+===========================================+
| 0     | ``ECok``       | no error                                  |
+-------+----------------+-------------------------------------------+
| -1    | ``ECnotify``   | message about correct behavior            |
+-------+----------------+-------------------------------------------+
| -2    | ``ECwarning``  | unusual but not incorrect behavior        |
+-------+----------------+-------------------------------------------+
| -3    | ``ECnonexist`` | a function input specifies an item that   |
|       |                | doesn’t exist                             |
+-------+----------------+-------------------------------------------+

|       |                | not be permitted                          |
+-------+----------------+-------------------------------------------+
| -6    | ``ECmissing``  | a necessary function input parameter is   |
|       |                | missing                                   |

Error checking system internal to libsmoldyn.c
----------------------------------------------

This section describes how to write ``libsmoldyn`` functions using error
checking. While it is an essential part of all ``libsmoldyn`` functions,
these details are not important for most ``libsmoldyn`` users.

1. The first line of every ``libsmoldyn`` function should be
   ``const char     *funcname="``\ *function_name*\ \`\ ``;``. This name
   will be returned with any error message to tell the user where the
   error arose.

2. Within the function, check for warnings or errors with the ``LCHECK``
   macro. The macro format is
   ``LCHECK(``\ *condition*\ ``,funcname,``\ *error_code*\ ``,"``\ *message*\ \`\ ``);``.
   This checks that the test *condition* is true, and issues a
   notification, warning, or error when this is not the case. The
   *message* should be a descriptive message that is under 256
   characters in length.

3. Most functions return an ``enum ErrorCode``. If this is the case for
   your function, and your function might return a notification and/or a
   warning, then end the main body of the function with
   ``return     libwarncode;``. If it cannot return a notification or a
   warning, then end it with ``return ECok;``. Finally, if it does not
   return an \`\ ``enum     ErrorCode``, then it needs to return some
   other error condition that will tell the user to check for errors
   using ``smolGetError``.

4. After the main body of the function, add a goto target called
   ``failure:``.

5. Assuming the function returns an \`\ ``enum ErrorCode``", end the
   function with ``return liberrorcode;``.

The ``smolSetTimeStep`` function provides an excellent and simple
example of how ``libsmoldyn`` functions typically address errors. It is:

.. code:: c

   enum ErrorCode smolSetTimeStep(simptr sim,double timestep) {
       const char *funcname="smolSetTimeStep";

       LCHECK(sim,funcname,ECmissing,"missing sim");
       LCHECK(timestep>0,funcname,ECbounds,"timestep is not > 0");
       simsettime(sim,timestep,3);
       return ECok;
    failure:
       return liberrorcode; }

The ``smolGet...Index`` functions are worth a comment. Each of these
functions returns the index of an item, such as a species or a surface,
based on the name of the item. If the name is not found or other errors
arise, then these functions return the error code, cast as an integer.
Also, if the name is ``all``, then these functions return the error code
``ECall`` and set the error string
``species cannot be ‘all’", or equivalent. A typical use of these functions is seen in``\ smolSetSpeciesMobility`,
which includes the following code:

.. code:: c

   i=smolGetSpeciesIndex(sim,species);
   if(i==(int)ECall) smolClearError();
   else LCHECK(i>0,funcname,ECsame,NULL);

In this particular case, this function permits an input of ``all``, so
it clears errors that arise from this return value, and leaves ``i`` as
a negative value for later use.

``libsmoldyn`` quick function guide
====================================

The ``libsmoldyn`` functions correspond relatively closely to the
Smoldyn language statements, although not perfectly. However, all
functionality should be available using either method. The following
table lists the correspondences. Statements preceded by asterisks need
to be either entered in statement blocks or preceded by the statement’s
context (e.g. with ``surface`` *name*). Where correspondence does not
apply, the table lists ``N/A``.

``libsmoldyn`` header file
==========================

Following is the entire ``libsmoldyn`` header file, ``libsmoldyn.h``.
This lists all of the function declarations. If there is a discrepancy
between declarations listed here and those listed in following sections,
the ones shown here are almost certainly the correct ones. This file
references smoldyn.h, which lists all of the data structure declarations
and enumerated type definitions.

If you compiled and installed Smoldyn using the default configuration,
both files should be in your ``/usr/local/include/smoldyn`` directory.
Also in this directory is the ``smoldyn_config.h`` file. This file was
used for compiling Smoldyn and ``libsmoldyn`` but is not needed
afterwards. Nevertheless, it’s copied to the /usr/local/include/smoldyn
directory so that programs that call ``libsmoldyn`` can know what
options ``libsmoldyn`` was built with.

``libsmoldyn`` functions
========================

General comments
----------------

None of the functions allocate memory, except within the simulation data
structure. This means, for example, that all functions that return
strings do not allocate these strings themselves, but instead write the
string text to memory that the library user allocated and gave to the
function. All strings are fixed at ``STRCHAR`` characters, where this
constant is defined in ``string2.h`` to 256 characters.

Miscellaneous
-------------

-  ``double smolGetVersion(void);`` Returns the Smoldyn version number.

Errors
------

-  | ``void smolSetError(const char *errorfunction,enum ErrorCode errorcode,const char *errorstring);``
   | This function is probably not useful for most users. Sets the
     ``libsmoldyn`` error code to ``errorcode``, error function to
     ``errorfunction``, and error string to ``errorstring``. The sole
     exception is if ``errorcode`` is ``ECsame`` then this does nothing
     and simply returns. Back to it’s normal operation, this also either
     sets or clears the ``libsmoldyn`` warning code, as appropriate. If
     ``errorstring`` is entered as ``NULL``, this clears the current
     error string, and similarly for ``errorfunction``.

-  | ``enum ErrorCode smolGetError(char *errorfunction,char *errorstring,int clearerror);``
   | Returns the current ``libsmoldyn`` error code directly, returns the
     function where the error occurred in ``errorfunction`` if it is not
     ``NULL``, and returns the error string in ``errorstring`` if it is
     not ``NULL``. Set ``clearerror`` to 1 to clear the error and 0 to
     leave any error condition unchanged.

-  ``void smolClearError(void);``

   Clears any error condition.

-  ``void smolSetDebugMode(int debugmode);``

   Enter ``debugmode`` as 1 to enable debugging and 0 to disable
   debugging. When debug mode is turned on, all errors are displayed to
   stderr, as are all cleared errors. By turning on debug mode, you can
   often avoid checking for errors with additional code and you also
   typically don’t need to call ``smolGetError``.

-  ``char* smolErrorCodeTostring(enum ErrorCode erc,char *string);``

   Returns a string both directly and in ``string`` that corresponds to
   the error code in ``erc``. For example, if ``erc`` is ``ECmemory``,
   this returns the string ``memory``.

Sim structure
-------------

-  | ``simptr smolNewSim(int dim,double *lowbounds,double *highbounds);``
   | Creates and returns a new sim structure. The structure is
     initialized for a ``dim`` dimensional system that has boundaries
     defined by the points ``lowbounds`` and ``highbounds``. Boundaries
     are transmitting (modify them with ``smolSetBoundaryType``).
     Returns ``NULL`` upon failure.

-  | ``enum ErrorCode smolUpdateSim(simptr sim);``
   | Updates the simulation structure. This calculates all simulation
     parameters from physical parameters, sorts lists, and generally
     does everything required to make a simulation ready to run. It may
     be called multiple times.

-  | ``enum ErrorCode smolRunTimeStep(simptr sim);``
   | Runs one time step of the simulation. Returns an error if the
     simulation terminates unexpectedly during this time step or a
     warning if it terminates normally.

-  | ``enum ErrorCode smolRunSim(simptr sim);``
   | Runs the simulation until it terminates. Returns an error if the
     simulation terminates unexpectedly during this time step or a
     warning if it terminates normally.

-  | ``enum ErrorCode smolRunSimUntil(simptr sim,double breaktime);``
   | Runs the simulation either until it terminates or until the
     simulation time equals or exceeds ``breaktime``.

-  | ``enum ErrorCode smolFreeSim(simptr sim);``
   | Frees the simulation data structure.

-  | ``enum ErrorCode smolDisplaySim(simptr sim);``
   | Displays all relevant information about the simulation system to
     stdout.

Read configuration file
-----------------------

-  | ``simptr smolPrepareSimFromFile(char *filepath,char *filename,char *flags);``
   | Reads the Smoldyn configuration file that is at ``filepath`` and
     has file name ``filename``, sets it up, and outputs simulation
     diagnostics to stdout. Returns the sim structure, or ``NULL`` if an
     error occurred. ``flags`` are the command line flags that are
     entered for normal Smoldyn use. Either or both of ``filepath`` and
     ``flags`` can be sent in as ``NULL`` if there is nothing to report.
     After this function runs successfully, it should be possible to
     call ``smolRunSim`` or ``smolRunTimeStep``.

-  | ``enum ErrorCode smolLoadSimFromFile(char *filepath,char *filename,simptr *simpointer,char *flags);``
   | Loads part or all of a sim structure from the file that is at
     ``filepath`` and has file name ``filename``. Send in ``simpointer``
     as a pointer to sim, where sim may be an existing simulation
     structure that this function will append or ``NULL`` if it is to be
     created by this function. ``flags`` are the command line flags that
     are entered for normal Smoldyn use. Either or both of ``filepath``
     and ``flags`` can be sent in as ``NULL`` if there is nothing to
     report. After this function runs successfully, call
     ``smolUpdateSim`` to calculate simulation parameters.

-  | ``enum ErrorCode smolReadConfigString(simptr sim,char *statement,char *parameters);``
   | Reads and processes what would normally be a single line of a
     configuration file. The first word of the line is the statement
     name, entered here as ``statement``, while the rest of the line is
     entered as ``parameters``. Separate different parameters with
     spaces. The same parser is used as for normal Smoldyn configuration
     files. This function does not make use of block style input
     formatting, such as for surface definitions. This means that a new
     surface needs to declared with ``new_surface`` **name** and all
     subsequent surface definitions need to start with surface **name**.
     Analogous rules apply to compartments and port.

Simulation settings
-------------------

-  | ``enum ErrorCode smolSetSimTimes(simptr sim,double timestart,double timestop,double timestep);``
   | Sets all of the simulation time parameters to the values entered
     here. In addition the simulation time ``now`` is set to
     ``timestart``.

-  | ``enum ErrorCode smolSetTimeStart(simptr sim,double timestart);``
   | Sets the simulation starting time.

-  | ``enum ErrorCode smolSetTimeStop(simptr sim,double timestop);``
   | Sets the simulation stopping time.

-  ``enum ErrorCode smolSetTimeNow(simptr sim,double timenow);`` Sets
   the simulation current time.

-  ``enum ErrorCode smolSetTimeStep(simptr sim,double timestep);`` Sets
   the simulation time step, which must be greater than 0.

-  ``enum ErrorCode smolSetRandomSeed(simptr sim,double seed);`` Sets
   the random number generator seed to ``seed`` if ``seed`` is at least
   0, and sets it to the current time value if ``seed`` is less than 0.

-  ``enum ErrorCode smolSetPartitions(simptr sim,char *method,double value);``
   Sets the virtual partitions in the simulation volume. Enter
   ``method`` as ``molperbox`` and then enter ``value`` with the
   requested number of molecules per partition volume; the default,
   which is used if this function is not called at all, is a target of 4
   molecules per box. Or, enter ``method`` as ``boxsize`` and enter
   ``value`` with the requested partition spacing. In this latter case,
   the actual partition spacing may be larger or smaller than the
   requested value in order to fit an integer number of partitions into
   each coordinate of the simulation volume.

Graphics
--------

-  | ``enum ErrorCode smolSetGraphicsParams(simptr sim,char *method,int timesteps,double delay);``
   | Sets basic simulation graphics parameters. Enter ``method`` as
     ``none`` for no graphics (the default), ``opengl`` for fast but
     minimal OpenGL graphics, ``opengl_good`` for improved OpenGL
     graphics, ``opengl_better`` for fairly good OpenGL graphics, or as
     ``NULL`` to not set this parameter currently. Enter ``timesteps``
     with a positive integer to set the number of simulation time steps
     between graphics renderings (1 is the default) or with a negative
     number to not set this parameter currently. Enter ``delay`` as a
     non-negative number to set the minimum number of milliseconds that
     must elapse between subsequent graphics renderings in order to
     improve visualization (0 is the default) or as a negative number to
     not set this parameter currently.

-  | ``enum ErrorCode smolSetTiffParams(simptr sim,int timesteps,char *tiffname,int lowcount,int highcount);``
   | Sets parameters for the automatic collection of TIFF format
     snapshots of the graphics window. ``timesteps`` is the number of
     simulation timesteps that should elapse between subsequent
     snapshots, ``tiffname`` is the root filename of the output TIFF
     files, ``lowcount`` is a number that is appended to the filename of
     the first snapshot and which is then incremented for subsequent
     snapshots, and ``highcount`` is the last numbered file that will be
     collected. Enter negative numbers for ``timesteps``, ``lowcount``,
     and/or ``highcount`` to not set these parameters, and enter
     ``NULL`` for ``tiffname`` to not set the file name.

-  | ``enum ErrorCode smolSetLightParams(simptr sim,int lightindex,double *ambient,double *diffuse,double *specular,double *position);``
   | Sets the lighting parameters that are used for the rendering method
     ``opengl_better``. Enter ``lightindex`` as -1 for the global
     ambient light (in which case ``diffuse``, ``specular``, and
     ``position`` should all be ``NULL``) or as 0 to 8 for one of the 8
     light sources. For each light source, you can specify the 4-value
     color vector for the light’s ambient, diffuse, and specular
     properties (all values should be between 0 and 1). You can also
     specify the 3-dimensional position for the light. To not set a
     property, just enter the respective vector as ``NULL``.

-  | ``enum ErrorCode smolSetBackgroundStyle(simptr sim,double *color);``
   | Sets the color of the graphics display background. ``color`` is a
     4-value vector with red, green, blue, and alpha values.

-  | ``enum ErrorCode smolSetFrameStyle(simptr sim,double thickness,double *color);``
   | Sets the thickness and the color of the wire frame that outlines
     the simulation system in the graphics window. Enter ``thickness``
     as 0 for no frame, as a positive number for the number of points in
     thickness, or as a negative number to not set this parameter. Enter
     ``color`` as a 4-value vector with the frame color, or as ``NULL``
     to not set it.

-  | ``enum ErrorCode smolSetGridStyle(simptr sim,double thickness,double *color);``
   | Sets the thickness and the color of a grid that shows where the
     partitions are that separate Smoldyn’s virtual boxes. Enter
     ``thickness`` as 0 for no grid, as a positive number for the number
     of points in thickness, or as a negative number to not set this
     parameter. Enter ``color`` as a 4-value vector with the grid color,
     or as ``NULL`` to not set it.

-  | ``enum ErrorCode  smolSetTextStyle(simptr sim,double *color);``
   | Sets the color of any text that is displayed to the graphics
     window. ``color`` is a 4-value vector with red, green, blue, and
     alpha values.

-  | ``enum ErrorCode smolAddTextDisplay(simptr sim,char *item);``
   | Adds ``item`` to the list of things that Smoldyn should display as
     text to the graphics window. Currently supported options are
     ``time`` and the names of species and, optionally, their states.
     For species and states, the graphics window shows the number of
     molecules.

Runtime commands
----------------

-  | ``enum ErrorCode smolSetOutputPath(simptr sim,char *path);``
   | Sets the file path for text output files to ``path``.

-  | ``enum ErrorCode  smolAddOutputFile(simptr sim,char *filename,int suffix,int append);``
   | Declares the file called ``filename`` as a file for output by one
     or more runtime commands. Note that spaces are not permitted in the
     file name. If ``suffix`` is non-negative, then the file name is
     suffixed by this integer, which can be helpful for creating output
     file stacks. Enter ``append`` as 1 if any current file should
     simply be appended, or to 0 if any current file should be
     overwritten.

-  | ``enum ErrorCode smolAddCommand(simptr sim,char type,double on,double off,double step,double multiplier,char *commandstring);``
   | Adds a run-time command to the simulation, including its timing
     instructions. This function should generally be called after
     ``smolSetSimTimes`` to make sure that command times get set
     correctly. The following table lists the command type options along
     with the other parameters that are used for each type. Parameters
     that are not required are simply ignored. The ``commandstring`` is
     the command name followed by any command parameters.

-  | ``enum ErrorCode``
   | ``smolAddCommandFromString(simptr sim,char *string);``
   | Defines a runtime command, including its execution timing
     parameters, from the string ``string``. This string should be
     identical to ones used in configuration files, except that they do
     not include the ``cmd`` statement.

Molecules
---------

-  | ``enum ErrorCode smolAddSpecies(simptr sim,char *species,char *mollist);``
   | Adds a molecular species named ``species`` to the system. If you
     have already created species lists and want all states of this
     species to live in a specific list, then enter it in ``mollist``;
     otherwise, enter ``mollist`` as ``NULL`` or an empty string to
     request default behavior.

-  | ``int smolGetSpeciesIndex(simptr sim,char *species);``
   | Returns the species index that corresponds to the species named
     ``species``. Upon failure, this function returns an error code cast
     as an integer.

-  | ``char* smolGetSpeciesName(simptr sim,int speciesindex,char *species);``
   | Returns the species name that corresponds to the species index in
     ``speciesindex``. The name is returned both in ``species`` and
     directly, where the latter simplifies function use. Upon failure,
     this function returns ``NULL``.

-  | ``enum ErrorCode smolSetSpeciesMobility(simptr sim,char *species,enum MolecState     state,double difc,double *drift,double *difmatrix);``
   | Sets any or all of the mobility coefficients for species
     ``species`` (which may be ``all``) and state ``state`` (which may
     be ``MSall``). ``difc`` is the isotropic diffusion coefficient,
     ``drift`` is the drift vector, and ``difmatrix`` is the square of
     the anisotropic diffusion matrix (see the User’s manual). To not
     set coefficients, enter a negative number in ``difc`` and/or enter
     a ``NULL`` pointer in the other inputs, respectively.

-  | ``int smolAddMolList(simptr sim,char *mollist);``
   | Adds a new molecule list, named ``mollist``, to the system.

-  | ``int smolGetMolListIndex(simptr sim,char *mollist);``
   | Returns the list index that corresponds to the list named
     ``mollist``.

-  | ``char* smolGetMolListName(simptr sim,int mollistindex,char *mollist);``
   | Returns the molecule list name that corresponds to the molecule
     list with index ``mollistindex``. The name is returned both in
     ``mollist`` and directly. On error, this function ``NULL``.

-  | ``enum ErrorCode smolSetMolList(simptr sim,char *species,enum MolecState state,char     *mollist);``
   | Sets the molecule list for species ``species`` (which may be
     ``all``) and state ``state`` (which may be ``MSall``) to molecule
     list ``mollist``.

-  | ``enum ErrorCode smolSetMaxMolecules(simptr sim,int maxmolecules);``
   | Sets the maximum number of molecules that can simultaneously exist
     in a system to ``maxmolecules``. At present, this function needs to
     be called for a simulation to run, although it will become optional
     once dynamic molecule memory allocation has been written.

-  | ``enum ErrorCode  smolAddSolutionMolecules(simptr sim,char *species,int number,double *lowposition,double *highposition);``
   | Adds ``number`` solution state molecules of species ``species`` to
     the system. They are randomly distributed within the box that has
     its opposite corners defined by ``lowposition`` and
     ``highposition``. Any or all of these coordinates can equal each
     other to place the molecules along a plane or at a point. Enter
     ``lowposition`` and/or ``highposition`` as ``NULL`` to indicate
     that the respective corner is equal to that corner of the entire
     system volume.

-  | ``enum ErrorCode smolAddCompartmentMolecules(simptr sim,char *species,int number,char *compartment);``
   | Adds ``number`` solution state molecules of species ``species`` to
     the compartment ``compartment``. Molecules are randomly distributed
     within the compartment.

-  | ``enum ErrorCode smolAddSurfaceMolecules(simptr sim,int speciesindex,enum MolecState state,int number,int surface,enum PanelShape panelshape,int panel,double *position);``
   | Adds ``number`` molecules of species ``species`` and state
     ``state`` to surface(s) in the system. It is permissible for
     ``surface`` to be ``all``, ``panelshape`` to be PSall, and/or
     ``panel`` to be ``all``. If you want molecules at a specific
     position, then you need to enter a specific surface, panel shape,
     and panel, and then enter the position in ``position``.

-  | ``int smolGetMoleculeCount(simptr sim,char *species,enum MolecState state);``
   | Returns the total number of molecules in the system that have
     species ``species`` (``all`` is permitted) and state ``state``
     (``MSall`` is permitted). Any error is returned as the error code
     cast as an integer.

-  | ``enum ErrorCode smolSetMoleculeStyle(simptr sim,const char *species,enum MolecState state,double size,double *color);``
   | Sets the graphical display parameters for molecules of species
     ``species`` (``all`` is permitted) and state ``state`` (``MSall``
     is permitted). Enter ``size`` with the drawing size (in pixels if
     graphics method is ``opengl`` and in simulation system length units
     for better drawing methods) or with a negative number to not set
     the size. Enter ``color`` with the 3-value color vector or with
     ``NULL`` to not set the color.

Surfaces
--------

-  | ``enum ErrorCode smolSetBoundaryType(simptr sim,int dimension,int highside,char type);``
   | Sets the molecule interaction properties for a system boundary that
     bounds the ``dimension`` axis. Enter ``dimension`` as -1 to
     indicate all dimensions. Set ``highside`` to 0 for the lower
     boundary, to 1 for the upper boundary, and to -1 for both
     boundaries. The boundary type is entered in ``type`` as ‘r’ for
     reflecting, ‘p’ for periodic, ‘a’ for absorbing, or ‘t’ for
     transmitting. Note that Smoldyn only observes these properties if
     no surfaces are declared; otherwise all boundaries are transmitting
     regardless of what’s entered here.

-  | ``int smolAddSurface(simptr sim,char *surface);``
   | Adds a surface called ``surface`` to the system.

-  | ``int smolGetSurfaceIndex(simptr sim,char *surface);``
   | Returns the surface index that corresponds to the surface named
     ``surface``. The index is non-negative. On failure, this returns an
     error code cast as an integer.

-  | ``char*  smolGetSurfaceName(simptr sim,int surfaceindex,char *surface);``
   | Returns the surface name for surface number ``surfaceindex`` both
     directly and in the ``surface`` string. On failure, this returns
     ``NULL``.

-  | ``enum ErrorCode smolSetSurfaceAction(simptr sim,char *surface,enum PanelFace face,char *species,enum MolecState state,enum SrfAction action);``
   | Sets the action that should happen when a molecule of species
     ``species`` (may be ``all``) and state ``state`` (may be ``MSall``)
     diffuses into face ``face`` (may be ``PFboth``) of surface
     ``surface``. The action is set to ``action``.

-  | ``enum ErrorCode smolSetSurfaceRate(simptr sim,char *surface,char *species,enum MolecState state,enum MolecState state1,enum MolecState state2,double rate,char *newspecies,int isinternal);``
   | Sets the surface interaction rate(s) for surface ``surface`` (may
     be ``all``) and species ``species`` (may be ``all``) and state
     ``state``. The transition being considered is from ``state1`` to
     ``state2`` (this function uses the tri-state format for describing
     surface interactions, shown below). The interaction rate is set to
     ``rate``, which is interpreted as a probability value for internal
     use if ``isinternal`` is 1 and as a physical interaction
     coefficient if ``isinternal`` is 0. If the molecule ends up
     interacting with the surface, it changes to new species
     ``newspecies``. Enter ``newspecies`` as either ``NULL`` or an empty
     string to indicate that molecules should not change species upon
     interactions. The molecule states are most easily understood with
     the following table. If the action listed in the table is in
     italics, then the corresponding combination of states is not a
     permitted input.

   ================= ========= ========== ========== ===========

-  | ``int``
   | ``smolAddPanel(simptr sim,char *surface,enum PanelShape     panelshape,char *panel,char *axisstring,double *params);``
   | Adds or modifies a panel of shape ``panelshape`` of surface
     ``surface``. ``axisstring`` lists any text parameters for the
     panel, which in practice is only a single word that gives the
     orientation of a rectangle panel (e.g. ``+0`` or ``-y``).
     ``params`` lists the numerical parameters for the panel location,
     size, and drawing characteristics. These are exactly the same
     parameters that are listed for the ``panel`` statement in Smoldyn
     configuration files, with the sole exception that the first
     rectangle ``parameter`` is actually a string that is entered in
     ``axisstring``. ``panelname`` is an optional parameter for naming
     the panel; if it is included and is not an empty string, the panel
     is named ``panelname``. If this panel name was already used by a
     panel of the same shape, then this function overwrites that panel’s
     data with the new data. If the name was already used by a panel
     with a different shape, then this creates an error, and if the name
     was not used before, then a new panel is created. To use default
     panel naming, send in ``panelname`` as either ``NULL`` or as an
     empty string. In the latter case, ``panelname`` is returned with
     the newly assigned default name.

-  | ``int``
   | ``smolGetPanelIndex(simptr sim,char *surface,enum PanelShape     *panelshapeptr,char *panel);``
   | Returns the panel index for the panel called ``panel`` on surface
     ``surface``. If ``panelshapeptr`` is not ``NULL``, this also
     returns the panel shape in ``panelshapeptr``. On failure, this
     returns the error code cast as an integer.

-  | ``char*``
   | ``smolGetPanelName(simptr sim,char *surface,enum PanelShape     panelshape,int panelindex,char *panel);``
   | Returns the name of the panel that is in surface ``surface``, has
     shape ``panelshape``, and has index ``panelindex``, both directly
     and in the string ``panel``. On failure, this returns ``NULL``.

-  | ``enum ErrorCode``
   | ``smolSetPanelJump(simptr sim,const char *surface,const char     *panel1,enum PanelFace face1,const char *panel2,enum PanelFace     face2,int isbidirectional);``
   | Sets a jumping link between face ``face1`` of panel ``panel1`` and
     face ``face2`` of panel ``panel2`` of surface ``surface``. The link
     goes from ``panel1`` to ``panel2`` if ``bidirectional`` is entered
     as 0 and goes in both directions if ``bidirectional`` is entered as
     1. None of the surface, panel, or face entries is allowed to be
     ``all``. This does not set the actions of any species to ``jump``,
     which has to be done using the ``smolSetSurfaceAction`` function.

-  | ``enum ErrorCode``
   | ``smolAddSurfaceUnboundedEmitter(simptr sim,const char *surface,enum     PanelFace face,const char *species,double emitamount,double     *emitposition);``
   | Adds information about a point molecular source so that face
     ``face`` of surface ``surface`` can have its absorption properties
     calculated so that the molecular concentrations will become the
     same as they would be if the surface weren’t there at all. The
     point molecular source emits molecules of species ``species``, with
     a rate of ``emitamount`` and is at location ``emitposition``. The
     emission rate does not need to be in absolute units, but only has
     to be correct relative to other unbounded emitters. None of the
     inputs to this function are allowed to be ``all``.

-  | ``enum ErrorCode``
   | ``smolSetSurfaceSimParams(simptr sim,const char *parameter,double     value);``
   | Sets the surface simulation parameter named with ``parameter`` to
     value ``value``. The possible parameters are ``epsilon``,
     ``margin``, and ``neighbordist``. In all cases, the defaults are
     nearly always good, although this function allows them to be
     modified if desired. Epsilon is the maximum distance away from a
     surface that Smoldyn is allowed to place a surface-bound molecule.
     Margin is the distance inside from the edge of a surface panel that
     Smoldyn will place surface-bound molecules that hop onto this
     panel. Neighbor distance is the maximum distance over which
     surface-bound molecules are allowed to hop to transition from one
     panel to a neighboring panel.

-  | ``enum ErrorCode``
   | ``smolAddPanelNeighbor(simptr sim,const char *surface1,const char     *panel1,const char *surface2,const char *panel2,int reciprocal);``
   | Adds panel ``panel2`` of surface ``surface2`` as a neighbor of
     panel ``panel1`` or surface ``surface1``, meaning that
     surface-bound molecules will be allowed to diffuse from ``panel1``
     to ``panel2``. These are not allowed to be the same panel. Also,
     ``all`` values are not permitted. Otherwise, essentially any
     possible entries are legitimate. If surface-bound molecules should
     also be allowed to diffuse from ``panel2`` to ``panel1``, enter
     ``reciprocal`` as 1; if not, enter ``reciprocal`` as 0.

-  | ``enum ErrorCode``
   | ``smolSetSurfaceStyle(simptr sim,const char *surface,enum PanelFace     face,enum DrawMode mode,double thickness,double *color,int     stipplefactor,int stipplepattern,double shininess);``
   | Sets the graphics output style for face ``face`` of surface
     ``surface``. ``mode`` is the drawing mode; enter it as ``DMnone``
     to not set this parameter and otherwise enter it as ``DMno`` to not
     draw the surface, ``DMvert`` for vertices, ``DMedge`` for edges, or
     ``DMface`` for faces. The ``thickness`` parameter gives the point
     size or line width for drawing vertices or edges, or can be entered
     as a negative number to not set this parameter. ``color`` is the
     4-value color vector for the surface, or can be entered as ``NULL``
     to not set this parameter. ``stipplefactor`` is the repeat distance
     for the entire edge stippling pattern, or can be entered as a
     negative number to not set it. ``stipplepattern`` is the edge
     stippling pattern, which needs to be between 0 and 0xFFFF, or can
     be entered as -1 to not set this parameter. And ``shininess`` is
     the surface shininess, for use with lighting in the
     ``opengl_better`` graphics display option, or can be entered as -1
     to not set this parameter. The parameters ``thickness``,
     ``stipplefactor``, and ``stipplepattern`` only apply to edge style
     drawing modes and ignore any input in the ``face`` entry. The
     ``shininess`` parameter only applies to the face style drawing
     modes.

Compartments
------------

-  | ``int``
   | ``smolAddCompartment(simptr sim,char *compartment);``
   | Adds a compartment called ``compartment`` to the system.

-  | ``int``
   | ``smolGetCompartmentIndex(simptr sim,char *compartment)``
   | Returns the index of the compartment named ``compartment``. On
     failure, this returns an error code cast as an integer.

-  | ``char*``
   | ``smolGetCompartmentName(simptr sim,int compartmentindex,char     *compartment)``
   | Returns the name of the compartment that has index
     ``compartmentindex`` both directly and in the string
     ``compartment``. Returns ``NULL`` if an error arises.

-  | ``enum ErrorCode``
   | ``smolAddCompartmentSurface(simptr sim,char *compartment,char     *surface);``
   | Adds surface ``surface`` as one of the bounding surfaces of
     compartment ``compartment``.

-  | ``enum ErrorCode``
   | ``smolAddCompartmentPoint(simptr sim,char *compartment,double     *point);``
   | Adds ``point`` as one of the interior-defining points of
     compartment ``compartment``.

-  | ``enum ErrorCode``
   | ``smolAddCompartmentLogic(simptr sim,char *compartment,enum CmptLogic     logic,char *compartment2);``
   | Modifies the current definition of compartment ``compartment``
     using a logical rule specified in ``logic`` and the definition of
     ``compartment2``.

Reactions
---------

-  | ``enum ErrorCode``
   | ``smolAddReaction(simptr sim,const char *reaction,const char     *reactant1,enum MolecState rstate1,const char *reactant2,enum     MolecState rstate2,int nproduct,const char **productspecies,enum     MolecState *productstates,double rate);``
   | Adds reaction named ``reaction`` to the system. This reaction can
     have up to two reactants, whose species are listed in ``reactant1``
     and ``reactant2`` and whose states are listed in ``rstate1`` and
     ``rstate2``. If the reaction has fewer than two reactants, set
     either or both of ``reactant1`` and ``reactant2`` to either
     ``NULL`` or an empty string. State the number of reaction products
     in ``nproduct``, list their species in ``productspecies``, and list
     their states in ``productstates``. To set the reaction rate, enter
     it in ``rate``; otherwise, enter ``rate`` as a negative number.

-  | ``int``
   | ``smolGetReactionIndex(simptr sim,int *orderptr,char *reaction);``
   | Returns the index and order for the reaction that is named
     ``reaction``. If the order is known, send in ``orderptr`` pointing
     to this value. If it is not known, send in ``orderptr`` equal to
     either ``NULL`` or pointing to a negative number; in this case, it
     will be returned pointing to the reaction order, if the reaction
     was found. On failure, this returns the error code, cast as an
     integer.

-  | ``char*``
   | ``smolGetReactionName(simptr sim,int order,int reactionindex,char     *reaction);``
   | Returns the name of the reaction that has reaction order ``order``
     and index ``reactionindex`` in the string ``reaction``. Also
     returns the result directly. Returns ``NULL`` if an error arises.

-  | ``enum ErrorCode``
   | ``smolSetReactionRate(simptr sim,int order,char *reaction,double     rate,int isinternal);``
   | Set the reaction rate to ``rate``. If this value is to be
     interpreted as an internal reaction rate parameter, meaning the
     production rate for zeroth order reactions, the reaction
     probability for first order reactions, or the binding radius for
     second order reactions, then set ``isinternal`` to 1. Rather than
     calling this function at all, it’s usually easier to use the
     ``rate`` parameter of the ``smolAddReaction`` function, although
     that doesn’t cope with internal rate values.

-  | ``enum ErrorCode``
   | ``smolSetReactionRegion(simptr sim,const char *reaction,const char     *compartment,const char *surface);``
   | Limits the spatial region where a reaction can take place to the
     compartment ``compartment`` and/or the surface ``surface``. To not
     set one of these limits, enter ``compartment`` and/or ``surface``
     as ``NULL``. To remove a previously set limit, enter
     ``compartment`` and/or ``surface`` as the empty string, \`".

-  | ``enum ErrorCode``
   | ``smolSetReactionProducts(simptr sim,const char *reaction,enum     RevParam method,double parameter,const char *product,double     *position);``
   | Sets the reaction product parameters for reaction ``reaction``. At
     a minimum, the ``method`` reversible parameter is required. Most of
     these methods require a single parameter, entered in ``parameter``.
     A few methods also require a product, in ``product`` and the
     relative position of this product in ``position``.

   If ``method`` is ``RPbounce``, then a negative number for the

Ports
-----

-  | ``enum ErrorCode``
   | ``smolAddPort(simptr sim,const char *port,const char *surface,enum     PanelFace face);``
   | Adds a port to the simulation. The port will be named ``port`` and
     will port at the ``face`` face of surface ``surface``.

-  | ``int``
   | ``smolGetPortIndex(simptr sim,const char *port);``
   | Returns the index of the port named ``port``.

-  | ``char*``
   | ``smolGetPortName(simptr sim,int portindex,char *port);``
   | Returns the name of the port with index ``portindex``, both
     directly and in ``port``.

-  | ``enum ErrorCode``
   | ``smolAddPortMolecules(simptr sim,const char *port,int nmolec,const     char *species,double **positions);``
   | Adds ``nmolec`` molecules to Smoldyn’s import buffer of port
     ``port``. These molecules will all have species ``species`` and
     state ``MSsoln``. Enter ``positions`` as ``NULL`` to have the
     molecules positioned randomly over the porting surface and as an
     ``nmolec`` length list of position vectors to have them located at
     those specific initial positions. These initial positions should be
     close to the porting surface, and on the Smoldyn system side of it.

-  | ``int``
   | ``smolGetPortMolecules(simptr sim,const char *port,const char     *species,enum MolecState state,int remove);``
   | Returns the number of molecules that are in Smoldyn’s export buffer
     of port ``port``. Enter ``species`` with the species of the
     molecules that should be retrieved, or ``all`` for all species.
     Enter ``state`` with the states of the molecules that should be
     retrieved, or ``MSall`` for all states. Enter ``remove`` with 1 to
     remove molecules from the export buffer after they are retrieved or
     with 0 to leave them in the buffer. If an error arises, this
     returns the error code cast as an integer.
